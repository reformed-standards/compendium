{"name":"The Nicene Creed","publication_year":381,"type":"creed","image":"nicene-creed.jpg","markdown":true,"text":" We believe in one God[a], the Father Almighty[b], Maker of heaven and earth[c], and of all things visible and invisible[d].  And in one Lord Jesus Christ[e], the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds[f]; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made[g], being of one substance with the Father[h], by whom all things were made[i].  Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven[j], and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man[k]; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate[l]; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures[m]; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father[n]; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.[o]  And we believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life[p]; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets[q].  And we believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.[r] We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins[s]; and we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.[t] ","verses":{"a":["Exod.20.2-Exod.20.3","Mark.12.29-Mark.12.31"],"b":["Eph.4.6","Mal.2.10","Gen.35.11"],"c":["Gen.1.1","Isa.44.24"],"d":["Col.1.16","Rom.1.20"],"e":["2Cor.1.3","1Thess.1.1","Rom.13.14"],"f":["John.3.16","Heb.1.6","Matt.14.33","Rev.1.8"],"g":["John.1.1","1John.1.5","John.8.12","John.20.28","1John.5.20","Ps.2.7","Heb.1.5","John.14.9"],"h":["John.10.30","Isa.44.6","Rev.1.8","Phil.2.6","John.10.38","Col.2.9"],"i":["John.1.1-John.1.3","John.1.10","John.1.14","Eph.3.9","1Cor.8.6","Col.1.15-Col.1.17"],"j":["1Thess.5.9","Acts.4.12","2Tim.3.15","John.6.51","John.6.38"],"k":["Matt.1.18","Luke.1.27","Luke.1.35","Phil.2.6-Phil.2.7","Rom.1.3"],"l":["Acts.2.36","Matt.27.2","Matt.27.26","Mark.15.15"],"m":["Matt.16.21","Mark.15.46","Luke.24.5-Luke.24.7","1Cor.15.3-1Cor.15.4"],"n":["John.20.17","1Tim.3.16","1Pet.3.21-1Pet.3.22","Acts.1.9","Mark.16.19"],"o":["Acts.1.10-Acts.1.11","Rev.1.7","John.5.22","Acts.10.42","Luke.1.33"],"p":["John.14.17","2Cor.3.17","Acts.5.3-Acts.5.4","John.3.5","Titus.3.5"],"q":["John.15.26","Luke.11.13","Matt.28.19","2Pet.1.21"],"r":["John.17.20-John.17.23","Eph.4.1-Eph.4.6","Col.1.18","Heb.12.23","Rev.21.27","Phil.4.3","Matt.18.20","Phlm.1.2","Rom.16.5","1Tim.3.15","Eph.2.20","Acts.2.42"],"s":["Matt.28.18-Matt.28.19","Eph.4.5","Gal.3.27","Matt.26.28","Luke.24.47","Acts.2.38","1Pet.3.21","Rom.6.3-Rom.6.4"],"t":["1Cor.15.12","1Cor.15.21-1Cor.15.22","John.3.16","1Cor.2.9","Rom.11.36"]}}
