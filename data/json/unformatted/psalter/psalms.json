The character of the godly; how holy they are, abstaining from every temptation to, or appearance of evil; and with pleasure meditating on, and endeavouring to fulfil the whole law of God, ver. 1-2; and how happy, planted in the nearest fellowship with Jesus, the River of Life, they prosper in their lawful attempts: They never fall from their grace or profession; and they shall stand with approbation at the judgment-seat of God, ver. 3. (2.) The sinfulness and misery of the wicked: How different from, and contrary to the godly in their inclinations, companions, exercises, and ends! How light and unsubstantial, as chaff, and ready to be hurled by the storms of infinite wrath, into the depths of hell, as cast and condemned in the righteous judgment of God! ver. 4-5. (3.) The great reason of the happiness of saints, and of the misery of sinners: The Lord loveth the righteous, and observes and approves of their inclinations and behaviour; but, as an enemy, he brings destructive vengeance upon the wicked, ver. 6.<br/>While I sing these important lines, let my soul lift up her eyes to that great pattern of perfection, Jesus, the man of God's right hand, who was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners; and who fulfilled all righteousness, magnified the law, and made it honourable for men ­ for me. United to his person, clothed with his righteousness, and all inflamed and animated with his redeeming love shed abroad in my heart, let me examine myself as in his sight; let me walk in him as my way, and follow him as my pattern and guide: Let me with solemn awe look to, and prepare for his last, his eternal judgment!

Yet, notwithstanding, I have him to be my King appointed; And over Zion, my holy hill, I have him King anointed.

Compare Psalm 18; 2 Samuel 3, 5, 8, 10, 18, 20. But the whole of it respects Jesus our Redeemer. Behold, (1.) The violent and harmonious, but unsuccessful opposition, which Jews and Gentiles of all ranks make to the person and redemption work of the great God my Saviour. Behold what ruin and woe they draw upon themselves by their attempts! ver. 1-5, 9. (2.) Behold how, notwithstanding all their raging malice and furious opposition, Jehovah instals our Redeemer King in his church, and infallibly fixeth him on his throne; avows him his only begotten Son, and gives unto him the Gentiles for his people! ver. 6-8. (3.) Behold Jehovah’s demand of serious consideration and fear of, joy in, and trust, obedience and love to his exalted Son, ver. 9-12. <br/><br/><br/>     While I sing, let me remark the horrid nature of sin; let me with broken heart, bewail my neglect of, and opposition to Jesus Christ. Let me with wonder bless his name, that I have not already perished in mine iniquity.

He recommends a holy filial awe of God, and careful abstinence from sin; together with a devoting of themselves, and their conduct and substance, to the Lord, ver. 2-5. (3.)

Floods of ill men affrighted me, death's pangs about me went; Hell's sorrows me environèd; death's snares did me prevent.  In my distress I called on God, cry to my God did I; He from his temple heard my voice, to his ears came my cry.  Th' earth, as affrighted, then did shake, trembling upon it seized: The hills' foundations movèd were, because he was displeased.  Up from his nostrils came a smoke, and from his mouth there came Devouring fire, and coals by it were turnèd into flame.  He also bowèd down the heav'ns, and thence he did descend; And thickest clouds of darkness did under his feet attend.  And he upon a cherub rode, and thereon he did fly; Yea, on the swift wings of the wind his flight was from on high.  He darkness made his secret place: about him, for his tent, Dark waters were, and thickest clouds of th' airy firmament.  And at the brightness of that light, which was before his eye, His thick clouds passed away, hailstones and coals of fire did fly.

His judgments were before me, I his laws put not from me.  Sincere before him was my heart; with him upright was I; And watchfully I kept myself from mine iniquity.

The shield of thy salvätion thou didst on me bestow: Thy right hand held me up, and great thy kindness made me grow.  And in my way my steps thou hast enlargèd under me, That I go safely, and my feet are kept from sliding free.  Mine en'mies I pursuèd have, and did them overtake; Nor did I turn again till I an end of them did make.  I wounded them, they could not rise; they at my feet did fall. Thou girdest me with strength for war; my foes thou brought'st down all:  And thou hast giv'n to me the necks of all mine enemies; That I might them destroy and slay, who did against me rise.  They crièd out, but there was none that would or could them save; Yea, they did cry unto the LORD, but he no answer gave.  Then did I beat them small as dust before the wind that flies; And I did cast them out like dirt upon the street that lies.

GOD knows the just man's days, and still their heritage remains.  They shall not be ashamed when they the evil time do see; And when the days of famine are, they satisfied shall be.  But wicked men, and foes of GOD, as fat of lambs, decay; They shall consume, yea, into smoke they shall consume away.  The wicked borrows, but the same again he doth not pay; Whereas the righteous mercy shows, and gives his own away.  For such as blessèd be of him the earth inherit shall; And they that cursèd are of him shall be destroyèd all.

Although he fall, yet shall he not be cast down utterly, Because the LORD with his own hand upholds him mightily.  I have been young, and now am old, yet have I never seen The just man left, nor that his seed for bread have beggars been.  He's ever merciful, and lends: his seed is blessed therefore. Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore.  For GOD loves judgment, and his saints leaves not in any case; They are kept ever; but cut off shall be the sinner's face.  The just inherit shall the land, and ever in it dwell: The just man's mouth doth wisdom speak; his tongue doth judgment tell.  In 's heart the law is of his God, his steps slide not away.

As the Mosaic system, and the covenant between God and Israel, as his peculiar people, promised remarkable temporal felicity to such as were obedient to the law, and denounced temporal miseries against those that were impious and profane; so the psalmist here cautions against stumbling at particular providences, which might appear contrary to the tenour of that covenant. Here are, (1.) Plain and express warnings against fretfulness at the prosperity of the wicked, in their wickedness, ver. 1, 7-8; with the arguments and reasons enforcing the same, viz. that the character of the wicked is ignominious, while that of the righteous is honourable, ver. 12, 14, 21, 26, 30-32; that the wicked, in the very height of their prosperity, are near to destruction, while the righteous, even in their adversity, have special protection from God, and shall never be ruined, ver. 2, 9-10, 13, 15, 17, 20, 28, 33-40; and that God hath special blessings in store for, and even in this life manifests distinguished kindness to, the righteous and their seed, ver. 11, 16, 18-19, 22-25, 28-29, 37. (2.) Here are proper and effectual remedies to prevent sinful fretting at the prosperity of the wicked, or troubles of the godly, viz. hoping in God as our Saviour; delighting in God as our companion, friend and portion; following him as our guide; departing from evil and doing good; waiting on the Lord, and keeping his way, ver. 3-6, 27, 34.<br/><br/><br/>Be thou, my soul, an accurate observer, of the matter and circumstances of every providence.

An engaging admonition to improve God's new-covenant grant of himself to be our God, as an excitement to exchange legal ceremonies into prayer, thanksgiving and holy obedience; or, at least, to give a remarkable preference to the latter, ver. 7-15. (3.) A terrible charge of hypocrisy, slander, contempt of God's word, and of atheistical imaginations concerning God, laid against the wicked, with a fearful sentence of condemnation founded thereon, ver. 16-22. (4.) An alarming warning of danger to the forgetters of God, and an encouraging promise to such as study to glorify him by a holy conversation, ver. 22-23.<br/><br/><br/>Sing this, my soul, with solemn awe, assisted before the great Searcher of hearts, and as by faith beholding Jesus in my nature, sitting on his great white throne, gathering the nations to his bar, opening the books, and judging mankind out of the things found written therein.

O God, thou to thine heritage didst send a plenteous rain, Whereby thou, when it weary was, didst it refresh again.  Thy congregation then did make their habitation there: Of thine own goodness for the poor, O God, thou didst prepare.  The Lord himself did give the word, the word abroad did spread; Great was the company of them the same who publishèd.  Kings of great armies foilèd were, and forced to flee away; And women, who remained at home, did distribute the prey.

Thy fury pour thou out on them, and indignätion; And let thy wrathful anger, Lord, fast hold take them upon.  All waste and desolate let be their habitätion; And in their tabernacles all inhabitants be none.  Because him they do persecute, whom thou didst smite before; They talk unto the grief of those whom thou hast wounded sore.

Out of the book of life let them be razed and blotted quite; Among the just and rïghteous let not their names be writ.  But now become exceeding poor and sorrowful am I: By thy salvation, O my God, let me be set on high.  The name of God I with a song most cheerfully will praise; And I, in giving thanks to him, his name shall highly raise.  This to the LORD a sacrifice more gräcious shall prove Than bullock, ox, or any beast that hath both horn and hoof.

His testimony and his law in Isr'el he did place, And charged our fathers it to show to their succeeding race;  That so the race which was to come might well them learn and know; And sons unborn, who should arise, might to their sons them show:  That they might set their hope in God, and suffer not to fall His mighty works out of their mind, but keep his precepts all:  And might not, like their fathers, be a stiff rebellious race; A race not right in heart; with God whose spirit not stedfast was.  The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows nor other arms did lack, When as the day of battle was, they faintly turnèd back.  They brake God's cov'nant, and refused in his commands to go; His works and wonders they forgot, which he to them did show.  Things marvellous he brought to pass; their fathers them beheld Within the land of Egypt done, yea, ev'n in Zoàn's field.  By him divided was the sea, he caused them through to pass; And made the waters so to stand, as like an heap it was.  With cloud by day, with light of fire all night, he did them guide. In desert rocks he clave, and drink, as from great depths, supplied.  He from the rock brought streams, like floods made waters to run down. Yet sinning more, in desert they provoked the Highest One.  For in their heart they tempted God, and, speaking with mistrust, They greedily did meat require to satisfy their lust.  Against the Lord himself they spake, and, murmuring, said thus, A table in the wilderness can God prepare for us?  Behold, he smote the rock, and thence came streams and waters great; But can he give his people bread? and send them flesh to eat?  The LORD did hear, and waxèd wroth; so kindled was a flame 'Gainst Jacob, and 'gainst Israel up indignation came.  For they believed not God, nor trust in his salvation had; Though clouds above he did command, and heav'n's doors open made,  And manna rained on them, and gave them corn of heav'n to eat. Man angels' food did eat; to them he to the full sent meat.  And in the heaven he did cause an eastern wind to blow; And by his powèr he let out the southern wind to go.  Then flesh as thick as dust he made to rain down them among; And feathered fowls, like as the sand which lieth the shore along.  At his command amidst their camp these show'rs of flesh down fell, All round about the tabernacles and tents where they did dwell.  So they did eat abundantly, and had of meat their fill; For he did give to them what was their own desire and will.  They from their lust had not estranged their heart and their desire; But while the meat was in their mouths, which they did so require,  God's wrath upon them came, and slew the fattest of them all; So that the choice of Israel, o'erthrown by death, did fall.  Yet, notwithstanding of all this, they sinnèd still the more; And though he had great wonders wrought, believed him not therefor:  Wherefore their days in vanity he did consume and waste; And by his wrath their wretched years away in trouble past.  But when he slew them, then they did to seek him show desire; Yea, they returned, and after God right early did enquire.  And that the Lord had been their Rock they did remember then; Ev'n that the high almighty God had their Redeemer been.  Yet with their mouth they flattered him, and spake but feignèdly; And they unto the God of truth with their false tongues did lie.  For though their words were good, their heart with him was not sincere; Unstedfast and perfidious they in his cov'nant were.  But, full of pity, he forgave their sin, them did not slay; Nor stirred up all his wrath, but oft his anger turned away.  For that they were but fading flesh to mind he did recall; A wind that passeth soon away, and not returns at all.  How often did they him provoke within the wilderness! And in the desert did him grieve with their rebelliousness!  Yea, turning back, they tempted God, and limits set upon Him, who in midst of Isr'el is the only Holy One.  They did not call to mind his pow'r, not yet the day when he Delivered them out of the hand of their fierce enemy;  Nor how great signs in Egypt land he openly had wrought; What miracles in Zoàn's field his hand to pass had brought.  How lakes and rivers everywhere he turnèd into blood; So that nor man nor beast could drink of standing lake or flood.  He brought among them swarms of flies, which did them sore annoy; And divers kinds of filthy frogs he sent them to destroy.  He to the caterpillar gave the fruits of all their soil; Their labours he delivered up unto the locusts' spoil.  Their vines with hail, their sycamores he with the frost did blast: Their beasts to hail he gave; their flocks hot thunderbolts did waste.  Fierce burning wrath he on them cast, and indignation strong, And troubles sore, by sending forth ill angels them among.  He to his wrath made way; their soul from death he did not save; But over to the pestilence the lives of them he gave.  In Egypt land the first-born all he smote down everywhere; Among the tents of Ham, ev'n these chief of their strength that were.  But his own people, like to sheep, thence to go forth he made; And he, amidst the wilderness, them, as a flock, did lead.  And he them safely on did lead, so that they did not fear; Whereas their en'mies by the sea quite overwhelmèd were.  To borders of his sanctuary the Lord his people led, Ev'n to the mount which his right hand for them had purchasèd.  The nätions of Canàan, by his almighty hand, Before their face he did expel out of their native land;  Which for inheritance to them by line he did divide, And made the tribes of Israel within their tents abide.  Yet God Most High they did provoke, and tempted ever still; And to observe his test'monies did not incline their will:  But, like their fathers, turnèd back, and dealt unfaithfully: Aside they turnèd, like a bow that shoots deceitfully.  For they to anger did provoke him with their places high; And with their graven images moved him to jealousy.  When God heard this, he waxèd wroth, and much loathed Isr'el then: So Shiloh's tent he left, the tent which he had placed with men.  And he his strength deliverèd into captivity; He left his glory in the hand of his proud enemy.  His people also he gave o'er unto the sword's fierce rage: So sore his wrath inflamèd was against his heritage.  The fire consumed their choice young men; their maids no marriage had; And when their priests fell by the sword, their wives no mourning made.  But then the Lord arose, as one that doth from sleep awake; And like a giant that, by wine refreshed, a shout doth make:  Upon his en'mies' hinder parts he made his stroke to fall; And so upon them he did put a shame perpetuàl.  Moreover, he the tabernacle of Joseph did refuse; The mighty tribe of Ephraim he would in no wise choose:  But he did choose Jehudah's tribe to be the rest above; And of mount Zion he made choice, which he so much did love.  And he his sanctuary built like to a palace high, Like to the earth which he did found to perpetuity.  Of David, that his servant was, he also choice did make, And even from the folds of sheep was pleasèd him to take:  From waiting on the ewes with young, he brought him forth to feed Israèl, his inheritance, his people, Jacob's seed.  So after the integrity he of his heart them fed; And by the good skill of his hands them wisely governèd.

The pelican of wilderness, The owl in desert, I do match; And, sparrow-like, companionless, Upon the house's top, I watch.  I all day long am made a scorn, Reproached by my malicious foes: The madmen are against me sworn, The men against me that arose.  For I have ashes eaten up, To me as if they had been bread; And with my drink I in my cup Of bitter tears a mixture made.  Because thy wrath was not appeased, And dreadful indignätion: Therefore it was that thou me raised, And thou again didst cast me down.  My days are like a shade alway, Which doth declining swiftly pass; And I am witherèd away, Much like unto the fading grass.  But thou, O LORD, shalt still endure, From change and all mutation free, And to all generations sure Shall thy remembrance ever be.  Thou shalt arise, and mercy yet Thou to mount Zion shalt extend: Her time for favour which was set, Behold, is now come to an end.  Thy saints take pleasure in her stones, Her very dust to them is dear. All heathen lands and kingly thrones On earth thy glorious name shall fear.  GOD in his glory shall appear, When Zion he builds and repairs. He shall regard and lend his ear Unto the needy's humble pray'rs:  Th' afflicted's pray'r he will not scorn. All times this shall be on record: And generations yet unborn Shall praise and magnify the LORD.  He from his holy place looked down, The earth he viewed from heav'n on high; To hear the pris'ner's mourning groan, And free them that are doomed to die;  That Zion, and Jerus'lem too, His name and praise may well record, When people and the kingdoms do Assemble all to praise the LORD.  My strength he weakened in the way, My days of life he shortenèd. My God, O take me not away In mid-time of my days, I said:  Thy years throughout all ages last. Of old thou hast establishèd The earth's foundation firm and fast: Thy mighty hands the heav'ns have made.  They perish shall, as garments do, But thou shalt evermore endure; As vestures, thou shalt change them so; And they shall all be changèd sure:  But from all changes thou art free; Thy endless years do last for aye. Thy servants, and their seed who be, Established shall before thee stay. ","commentary":{"john_brown":"This psalm relates to some grievous distress; wherein are observable, (1.)

Who of his chambers doth the beams within the waters lay; Who doth the clouds his chariot make, on wings of wind make way.  Who flaming fire his ministers, his angels spirits, doth make: Who earth's foundätions did lay, that it should never shake.  Thou didst it cover with the deep, as with a garment spread: The waters stood above the hills, when thou the word but said.  But at the voice of thy rebuke they fled, and would not stay; They at thy thunder's dreadful voice did haste them fast away.  They by the mountains do ascend, and by the valley-ground Descend, unto that very place which thou for them didst found.  Thou hast a bound unto them set, that they may not pass over, That they do not return again the face of earth to cover.  He to the valleys sends the springs, which run among the hills: They to all beasts of field give drink, wild asses drink their fills.  By them the fowls of heav'n shall have their habitätion, Which do among the branches sing with delectätion.  He from his chambers watereth the hills, when they are dried: With fruit and increase of thy works the earth is satisfied.  For cattle he makes grass to grow, he makes the herb to spring For th' use of man, that food to him he from the earth may bring;  And wine, that to the heart of man doth cheerfulness impart, Oil that his face makes shine, and bread that strengtheneth his heart.  The trees of GOD are full of sap; the cedars that do stand In Lebanon, which planted were by his almighty hand.  Birds of the air upon their boughs do choose their nests to make; As for the stork, the fir-tree she doth for her dwelling take.  The lofty mountains for wild goats a place of refuge be; The conies also to the rocks do for their safety flee.  He sets the moon in heav'n, thereby the seasons to discern: From him the sun his certain time of going down doth learn.  Thou darkness mak'st, 'tis night, then beasts of forests creep abroad. The lions young roar for their prey, and seek their meat from God.  The sun doth rise, and home they flock, down in their dens they lie. Man goes to work, his labour he doth to the evening ply.  How manifold, LORD, are thy works! in wisdom wonderful Thou ev'ry one of them hast made; earth's of thy riches full:  So is this great and spacious sea, wherein things creeping are, Which numbered cannot be; and beasts both great and small are there.  There ships go; there thou mak'st to play that leviàthan great. These all wait on thee, that thou may'st in due time give them meat.  That which thou givest unto them they gather for their food; Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally, they fillèd are with good.  Thou hid'st thy face; they troubled are, their breath thou tak'st away; Then do they die, and to their dust return again do they.  Thy quick'ning spirit thou send'st forth, then they created be; And then the earth's decayèd face renewèd is by thee.  The glory of the mighty LORD continue shall for ever: The Lord JEHOVAH shall rejoice in all his works together.  Earth, as affrighted, trembleth all, if he on it but look; And if the mountains he but touch, they presently do smoke.

The LORD Almighty, and his strength, with stedfast hearts seek ye: His blessèd and his gracious face seek ye continually.  Think on the works that he hath done, which admiration breed; His wonders, and the judgments all which from his mouth proceed;  O ye that are of Abr'ham's race, his servant well approv'n; And ye that Jacob's children are, whom he chose for his own.  Because he, and he only, is the mighty LORD our God; And his most righteous judgments are in all the earth abroad.  His cov'nant he remembered hath, that it may ever stand: To thousand generätions the word he did command.  Which covènant he firmly made with faithful Abraham, And unto Isaac, by his oath, he did renew the same:  And unto Jacob, for a law, he made it firm and sure, A covènant to Israèl, which ever should endure.  He said, I'll give Canàan's land for heritage to you; While they were strangers there, and few, in number very few:  While yet they went from land to land without a sure abode; And while through sundry kingdoms they did wander far abroad;  Yet, notwithstanding, suffered he no man to do them wrong: Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove kings, who were great and strong.  Thus did he say, Touch ye not those that mine anointed be, Nor do the prophets any harm that do pertain to me.  He called for famine on the land, he brake the staff of bread: But yet he sent a man before, by whom they should be fed;  Ev'n Joseph, whom unnaturally sell for a slave did they; Whose feet with fetters they did hurt, and he in irons lay;  Until the time that his word came to give him liberty; The word and purpose of the LORD did him in prison try.  Then sent the king, and did command that he enlarged should be: He that the people's ruler was did send to set him free.  A lord to rule his family he raised him, as most fit; To him of all that he possessed he did the charge commit:  That he might at his pleasure bind the princes of the land; And he might teach his senators wisdom to understand.  The people then of Israèl down into Egypt came; And Jacob also sojournèd within the land of Ham.  And he did greatly by his power increase his people there; And stronger than their enemies they by his blessing were.  Their heart he turnèd to envy his folk maliciously, With those that his own servants were to deal in subtlety.  His servant Moses he did send, Aaron his chosen one. By these his signs and wonders great in Ham's land were made known.  Darkness he sent, and made it dark; his word they did obey. He turned their waters into blood, and he their fish did slay.  The land in plenty brought forth frogs in chambers of their kings. His word all sorts of flies and lice in all their borders brings.  He hail for rain, and flaming fire into their land he sent: And he their vines and fig-trees smote; trees of their coasts he rent.  He spake, and caterpillars came, locusts did much abound; Which in their land all herbs consumed, and all fruits of their ground.  He smote all first-born in their land, chief of their strength each one. With gold and silver brought them forth, weak in their tribes were none.  Egypt was glad when forth they went, their fear on them did light. He spread a cloud for covering, and fire to shine by night.  They asked, and he brought quails: with bread of  heav'n  he fillèd them. He opened rocks, floods gushed, and ran in deserts like a stream.  For on his holy promise he, and servant Abr'ham, thought. With joy his people, his elect with gladness, forth he brought.  And unto them the pleasant lands he of the heathen gave; That of the people's labour they inheritance might have.  That they his statutes might observe according to his word; And that they might his laws obey. Give praise unto the LORD.

Remember me, LORD, with that love which thou to thine dost bear; With thy salvation, O my God, to visit me draw near:  That I thy chosen's good may see, and in their joy rejoice; And may with thine inheritance triumph with cheerful voice.  We with our fathers sinnèd have, and of iniquity Too long we have the workers been; we have done wickedly.  The wonders great, which thou, O Lord, didst work in Egypt land, Our fathers, though they saw, yet them they did not understand:  And they thy mercies' multitude kept not in memory; But at the sea, ev'n the Red Sea, provoked him grievously.  Nevertheless he savèd them, ev'n for his own name's sake; That so he might to be well known his mighty powèr make.  When he the Red Sea did rebuke, then drièd up it was: Through depths, as through the wilderness, he safely made them pass.  From hands of those that hated them he did his people save; And from the en'my's cruel hand to them redemption gave.  The waters overwhelmed their foes; not one was left alive. Then they believed his word, and praise to him in songs did give.  But soon did they his mighty works forget unthankfully, And on his counsel and his will did not wait patiently;  But much did lust in wilderness, and God in desert tempt. He gave them what they sought, but to their soul he leanness sent.  And against Moses in the camp their envy did appear; At Aaron they, the saint of GOD, envìous also were.  Therefore the earth did open wide, and Dathan did devour, And all Abiram's company did cover in that hour.  Likewise among their company a fire was kindled then; And so the hot consuming flame burnt up these wicked men.  Upon the hill of Horeb they an idol-calf did frame, A molten image they did make, and worshippèd the same.  And thus their glory, and their God, most vainly changèd they Into the likeness of an ox that eateth grass or hay.  They did forget the mighty God, that had their saviour been, By whom such great things brought to pass they had in Egypt seen.  In Ham's land he did wondrous works, things terrible did he, When he his mighty hand and arm stretched out at the Red Sea.  Then said he, He would them destroy, had not, his wrath to stay, His chosen Moses stood in breach, that them he should not slay.  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, believèd not his word: But in their tents they murmurèd, not heark'ning to the LORD.  Therefore in desert them to slay he lifted up his hand: 'Mong nations to o'erthrow their seed, and scatter in each land.  They unto Bàal-pèor did themselves associate; The sacrifices of the dead they did profanely eat.  Thus, by their lewd invëntions, they did provoke his ire; And then upon them suddenly the plague brake in as fire.  Then Phin'has rose, and justice did, and so the plague did cease; That to all ages counted was to him for righteousness.  And at the waters, where they strove, they did him angry make, In such sort, that it farèd ill with Moses for their sake:  Because they there his spirit meek provokèd bitterly, So that he uttered with his lips words unadvisedly.  Nor, as the LORD commanded them, did they the nations slay: But with the heathen mingled were, and learned of them their way.  And they their idols served, which did a snare unto them turn. Their sons and daughters they to devils in sacrifice did burn.  In their own children's guiltless blood their hands they did imbrue, Whom to Canàan's idols they for sacrifices slew:  So was the land defiled with blood. They stained with their own way, And with their own invëntions a whoring they did stray.  Against his people kindled was the wrath of GOD therefore, Insomuch that he did his own inheritance abhor.  He gave them to the heathen's hand; their foes did them command. Their en'mies them oppressed, they were made subject to their hand.  He many times delivered them; but with their counsel so They him provoked, that for their sin they were brought very low.  Yet their affliction he beheld, when he did hear their cry: And he for them his covenant did call to memory;  After his mercies' multitude he did repent: And made Them to be pitied of all those who did them captive lead.  O LORD our God, us save, and gather the heathen from among, That we thy holy name may praise in a triumphant song.  Blessed be JEHOVAH, Isr'el's God, to all eternity: Let all the people say, Amen.

Like to the garment let it be which doth himself array, And for a girdle, wherewith he is girt about alway.  From GOD let this be their reward that en'mies are to me, And their reward that speak against my soul maliciously.  But do thou, for thine own name's sake, O GOD the Lord, for me: Sith good and sweet thy mercy is, from trouble set me free.  For I am poor and indigent, afflicted sore am I, My heart within me also is wounded exceedingly.  I pass like a declining shade, am like the locust tossed: My knees through fasting weakened are, my flesh hath fatness lost.  I also am a vile reproach unto them made to be; And they that did upon me look did shake their heads at me.  O do thou help and succour me, who art my God and LORD: And, for thy tender mercy's sake, safety to me afford:  That thereby they may know that this is thy almighty hand; And that thou, LORD, hast done the same, they may well understand.  Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord, bless thou with loving voice: Let them ashamed be when they rise; thy servant let rejoice.  Let thou mine adversaries all with shame be clothèd over; And let their own confüsion them, as a mantle, cover.  But as for me, I with my mouth will greatly praise the LORD; And I among the multitude his praises will record.

Fervent supplications that God would hear his prayer; ver. 1, 7; forgive his sins, ver. 2; manifest his favours, ver. 6-8; direct him in the way of duty, ver. 8-10; quicken him in it, ver. 11; deliver him out of trouble, ver.9, 11; and, in fine, punish his persecutors, ver. 12.<br/><br/><br/>What time my heart is overwhelmed, let God lead me to the Rock that is higher than I. Let me study to have my sin removed first, in order that my troubles may remove in due order, and with a rich blessing.

It, and the five which follow, consist of pure praises to God, without so much as one complaint or petition. Here, (1.) David engageth himself, and encourageth others to praise God, ver. 1-7, 10, 21. (2.) He represents the grounds of praise, viz the greatness and glory, sovereign power, and eternity of God, and the greatness and glory of his works, ver. 3-7, 11-13; his unbounded goodness, mercy, and compassion, ver. 7-9; manifested in pitying the afflicted, providing what is necessary for all creatures; and in his readiness to hear and answer his people's prayers, preserve them from evil, and destroy their enemies, ver. 14-20.<br/><br/><br/>In such high praises of God, may all my prayers issue at last. And the nearer I approach to mine end, let my heart and lips be the more filled with his praise, and honour all the day.
