      That man hath perfect blessedness
      who walketh not astray
      In counsel of ungodly men,
      nor stands in sinners' way,

      Nor sitteth in the scorner's chair:
      But placeth his delight
      Upon GOD's law, and meditates
      on his law day and night.

      He shall be like a tree that grows
      near planted by a river,
      Which in his season yields his fruit,
      and his leaf fadeth never:

      And all he doth shall prosper well.
      The wicked are not so;
      But like they are unto the chaff,
      which wind drives to and fro.

      In judgment therefore shall not stand
      such as ungodly are;
      Nor in th' assembly of the just
      shall wicked men appear.

      For why? the way of godly men
      unto the LORD is known:
      Whereas the way of wicked men
      shall quite be overthrown.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Perhaps this psalm was added by Ezra, or whoever else was the
        collector of the others into one book. We have represented to us in
        it, (1.) The character of the godly; how holy they are, abstaining
        from every temptation to, or appearance of evil; and with pleasure
        meditating on, and endeavouring to fulfil the whole law of God, ver.
        1-2; and how happy, planted in the nearest fellowship with Jesus, the
        River of Life, they prosper in their lawful attempts: They never fall
        from their grace or profession; and they shall stand with approbation
        at the judgment-seat of God, ver. 3. (2.) The sinfulness and misery of
        the wicked: How different from, and contrary to the godly in their
        inclinations, companions, exercises, and ends! How light and
        unsubstantial, as chaff, and ready to be hurled by the storms of
        infinite wrath, into the depths of hell, as cast and condemned in the
        righteous judgment of God! ver. 4-5. (3.) The great reason of the
        happiness of saints, and of the misery of sinners: The Lord loveth the
        righteous, and observes and approves of their inclinations and
        behaviour; but, as an enemy, he brings destructive vengeance upon the
        wicked, ver. 6.<br/>While I sing these important lines, let my soul
        lift up her eyes to that great pattern of perfection, Jesus, the man
        of God's right hand, who was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate
        from sinners; and who fulfilled all righteousness, magnified the law,
        and made it honourable for men - for me. United to his person, clothed
        with his righteousness, and all inflamed and animated with his
        redeeming love shed abroad in my heart, let me examine myself as in
        his sight; let me walk in him as my way, and follow him as my pattern
        and guide: Let me with solemn awe look to, and prepare for his last,
        his eternal judgment!

      Why rage the heathen? and vain things
      why do the people mind?
      Kings of the earth do set themselves,
      and princes are combined,

      To plot against the LORD, and his
      Anointed, saying thus,
      Let us asunder break their bands,
      and cast their cords from us.

      He that in heaven sits shall laugh;
      the Lord shall scorn them all.
      Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
      in rage he vex them shall.

      Yet, notwithstanding, I have him
      to be my King appointed;
      And over Zion, my holy hill,
      I have him King anointed.

      The sure decree I will declare;
      the LORD hath said to me,
      Thou art mine only Son; this day
      I have begotten thee.

      Ask of me, and for heritage
      the heathen I'll make thine;
      And, for possession, I to thee
      will give earth's utmost line.

      Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod
      of iron, break them all;
      And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt
      them dash in pieces small.

      Now, therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,
      ye judges of the earth:
      Serve GOD in fear, and see that ye
      join trembling with your mirth.

      Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
      ye perish from the way,
      If once his wrath begin to burn:
      bless'd all that on him stay.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Perhaps this psalm relates partly to David's instalment on his throne,
        and the victories over his enemies which attended it. Compare Psalm
        18; 2 Samuel 3, 5, 8, 10, 18, 20. But the whole of it respects Jesus
        our Redeemer. Behold, (1.) The violent and harmonious, but
        unsuccessful opposition, which Jews and Gentiles of all ranks make to
        the person and redemption work of the great God my Saviour. Behold
        what ruin and woe they draw upon themselves by their attempts! ver.
        1-5, 9. (2.) Behold how, notwithstanding all their raging malice and
        furious opposition, Jehovah instals our Redeemer King in his church,
        and infallibly fixeth him on his throne; avows him his only begotten
        Son, and gives unto him the Gentiles for his people! ver. 6-8. (3.)
        Behold Jehovah's demand of serious consideration and fear of, joy in,
        and trust, obedience and love to his exalted Son, ver. 9-12.
        <br/><br/><br/>     While I sing, let me remark the horrid nature of
        sin; let me with broken heart, bewail my neglect of, and opposition to
        Jesus Christ. Let me with wonder bless his name, that I have not
        already perished in mine iniquity. Let me with earnestness accept that
        once debased Redeemer, as my Saviour, my sovereign, my proprietor, my
        God, my all. Let me learn to know him, rejoice in him, and with holy
        awe, commit my whole salvation, and the salvation of my country, nay,
        of all the ends of the earth to him.

      O LORD, how are my foes increased?
      against me many rise.
      Many say of my soul, For him
      in God no succour lies.

      Yet thou my strength and glory art,
      th' uplifter of mine head.
      I cried, and, from his holy hill,
      the LORD me answer made.

      I laid me down and slept, I waked;
      for GOD sustainèd me.
      I will not fear though thousands ten
      set round against me be.

      Arise, O LORD; save me, my God;
      for thou my foes hast stroke
      All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth
      of wicked men hast broke.

      Salvätion doth appertain
      unto the LORD alone:
      Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore
      thy people is upon.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Having beheld the royal dignity of my Redeemer, let me here behold the
        joy, the peace, the safety of the redeemed, amidst their distresses
        innumerable. Here David, driven from his holy capital and high throne,
        by his rebellious son Absalom, ( 1.) Complains to his God of the
        number and malice of his enemies, ver. 1-2. (2.) He encourageth
        himself in his God, as the source and subject-matter of his safety,
        joy, and honour, ver. 3. (3.) He recollects, how, on former occasions,
        his troubles had driven him to his prayers; how he had always found
        God ready to hear and grant his requests; how safe and easy he had
        lived under his protection; and how effectually he had broken the
        power and restrained the malice of his enemies, ver 4-5, 7. ( 4.)
        Triumphantly trusting in God, as the salvation and blesser of his
        people, he silenceth all his fears, and pours forth his prayers for
        new protection and deliverance, ver. 6, 8. <br/><br/><br/> Think, my
        soul, of Jesus, who, when bulls of Bashan compassed him about, trusted
        in God, that he would deliver him. In all my distress, let me pour out
        my heart before him, believing in him as God, even my God. Let me
        always rejoice in the great God my Saviour. Let me trust in him at all
        times, that as he hath delivered, and doth deliver, so he will deliver
        me.

      Give ear unto me when I call,
      God of my righteousness:
      Have mercy, hear my prayer; thou hast
      enlarged me in distress.

      O ye the sons of men! how long
      will ye love vanities?
      How long my glory turn to shame,
      and will ye follow lies?

      But know, that for himself the LORD
      the godly man doth choose:
      The LORD, when I on him do call,
      to hear will not refuse.

      Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart
      on bed, and silent be.
      Off'rings present of righteousness,
      and in the LORD trust ye.

      O who will show us any good?
      is that which many say:
      But of thy countenance the light,
      LORD, lift on us alway.

      Upon my heart, bestowed by thee,
      more gladness I have found
      Than they, ev'n then, when corn and wine
      did most with them abound.

      I will both lay me down in peace,
      and quiet sleep will take;
      Because thou only me to dwell
      in safety, LORD, dost make.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was, perhaps, composed on the same occasion as the former,
        when David fled from Absalom his son. Here, (1.) David encouraged by
        former experience, casts his burden on the Lord, and supplicates a
        merciful deliverance, ver. 1. (2.) Addressing himself to men,
        particularly to his persecutors, he reproves their contempt of God and
        religion, their delight in, and practice of vanity, fraud, and
        falsehood. He represents the happiness of the saints in having God
        their protector, and ready to hear their requests. He recommends a
        holy filial awe of God, and careful abstinence from sin; together with
        a devoting of themselves, and their conduct and substance, to the
        Lord, ver. 2-5. (3.) To encourage them to the study of practical
        religion, he remarks, what superlative satisfaction and rest himself
        had found in familiar fellowship with God, and in a believing
        dependence on him, ver. 6-8. <br/><br/> <br/>While I sing, let me have
        faith in God, as my own God in Christ. Let me abhor that levity of
        mind, that deceitfulness, that earthly mindedness proper to the
        ungodly, and every remain thereof. Let my soul pant for Jehovah, and
        prefer him to everything else. Let me, by faith, lay meyself down in
        his arms, his bosom, as all my salvation and comfort.

      Give ear unto my words, O LORD,
      my meditation weigh.
      Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;
      for I to thee will pray.

      LORD, thou shalt early hear my voice:
      I early will direct
      My prayer to thee; and, looking up,
      an answer will expect.

      For thou art not a God that doth
      in wickedness delight;
      Neither shall evil dwell with thee,
      nor fools stand in thy sight.

      All that ill-doers are thou hat'st;
      cutt'st off that liars be:
      The bloody and deceitful man
      abhorrèd is by thee.

      But I into thy house will come
      in thine abundant grace;
      And I will worship in thy fear
      toward thy holy place.

      Because of those mine enemies,
      LORD, in thy righteousness
      Do thou me lead; do thou thy way
      make straight before my face.

      For in their mouth there is no truth,
      their inward part is ill;
      Their throat's an open sepulchre,
      their tongue doth flatter still.

      O God, destroy them; let them be
      by their own counsel quelled:
      Them for their many sins cast out,
      for they 'gainst thee rebelled.

      But let all joy that trust in thee,
      and still make shouting noise;
      For them thou sav'st: let all that love
      thy name in thee rejoice.

      For, LORD, unto the righteous man
      thou wilt thy blessing yield:
      With favour thou wilt compass him
      about, as with a shield.

        in his ordinances of meditation, prayer, praise, etc., ver. 1-7. (2.)

        his enemies had rendered difficult to perform; supplicating and
        predicting the ruin of his implacable foes; and, in the assured faith
        of obtaining it, imploring comfort and prosperity to his fellow
        saints, ver. 8-12.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let my heart and flesh

        cultivate the closest familiarity with the Lord my God. Let my prayers

      My soul is also vexèd sore;
      But, LORD, how long stay wilt thou make?
      Return, O LORD, my soul set free;
      O save me, for thy mercies' sake.

      Because those that deceasèd are
      Of thee shall no remembrance have;
      And who is he that will to thee
      Give praises lying in the grave?

      I with my groaning weary am,

      Mine eye, consumed with grief, grows old,
      Because of all mine enemies.
      Hence from me, wicked workers all;
      For GOD hath heard my weeping cries.

        Observe here, (1.) David, a great saint, under grievous and manifold
        troubles, sickness of body, conscience-felt charges of guilt, vexation
        of mind, attended with desertion from God, and contemptuous insults
        from his enemies, ver. 2, 3, 5, 7, 9. (2.) His supplications, with
        strong cries and tears, to God for mitigation of trouble, support
        under it, and deliverance from it, ver. 1, 4, 6. (3.) His triumphant
        separation of himself from the wicked, in the full assurance of faith,
        that God had heard, and would graciously grant his requests, and would
        either convert or destroy his opposers, ver. 8, 10.<br/><br/><br/>In
        all my afflictions, let me believe that Jesus was afflicted for me.
        Let me call my sin to remembrance, spread my case before him, fill my
        mouth with arguments; implore his abundant, free, and sovereign mercy,
        as my sole and all-comprehensive relief. Nor let me ever expect a
        comfortable answer to my prayers, while I cultivate an intimacy with
        profane and wicked men.

      O LORD my God, in thee do I
      my confidence repose:
      Save and deliver me from all
      my persecuting foes;

      Lest that the enemy my soul
      should, like a lion, tear,
      In pieces rending it, while there
      is no deliverer.

      O LORD my God, if it be so
      that I committed this;
      If it be so that in my hands
      iniquity there is:

      If I rewarded ill to him
      that was at peace with me;
      (Yea, ev'n the man that without cause
      my foe was I did free);

      Then let the foe pursue and take
      my soul, and my life thrust
      Down to the earth, and let him lay
      mine honour in the dust.

      Rise in thy wrath, LORD, raise thyself,
      for my foes raging be;
      And, to the judgment which thou hast
      commanded, wake for me.

      So shall th' assembly of thy folk
      about encompass thee:
      Thou therefore, for their sakes, return
      unto thy place on high.

      The LORD he shall the people judge:
      my judge, JEHOVAH, be,
      After my righteousness, and mine
      integrity in me.

      O let the wicked's malice end;
      but stablish stedfastly
      The righteous: for the righteous God
      the hearts and reins doth try.

      In God, who saves th' upright in heart,
      is my defence and stay.
      God just men judgeth, God is wroth
      with ill men ev'ry day.

      If he do not return again,
      then he his sword will whet;
      His bow he hath already bent,
      and hath it ready set:

      He also hath for him prepared
      the instruments of death;
      Against the persecutors he
      his shafts ordainèd hath.

      Behold, he with iniquity
      doth travail, as in birth;
      A mischief he conceivèd hath,
      and falsehood shall bring forth.

      He made a pit, and digged it deep,
      another there to take;
      But he is fall'n into the ditch
      which he himself did make.

      Upon his own head his mischief
      shall be returnèd home;
      His vi'lent dealing also down
      on his own pate shall come.

      According to his righteousness
      the LORD I'll magnify;
      And will sing praise unto the name
      of GOD that is most high.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Here, accused of traitorous conspiracy against his sovereign by king
        Saul, or by Cush one of his courtiers, David, (1.) Appeals to God,
        concerning his innocency of that crime, ver. 3-5. (2.) He supplicates,
        that God, as governor of the world, and King of Israel, would protect
        him from danger, plead his cause and give judgment for him, ver. 1, 2,
        6, 9. (3.) In the exercise of faith, he depends on God, to protect and
        deliver him, and to avenge the injuries he had sustained upon his
        implacable adversaries, ver. 10, 16. (4.) He resolves to ascribe the
        glory of all his deliverances to God alone, ver. 17. While I sing, let
        me contemplate the spotless innocency, the finished righteousness of
        my Redeemer, together with the injurious usage he received from his
        brethren of mankind and the fearful ruin which hath befallen, or

        sight who searcheth my heart, and trieth my reins, and who must

        be the glory and praise of all my protection and deliverance.

      How excellent in all the earth,
      LORD, our Lord, is thy name!
      Who hast thy glory far advanced
      above the starry frame.

      From infants' and from sucklings' mouth
      thou didest strength ordain,
      For thy foes' cause, that so thou might'st
      th' avenging foe restrain.

      When I look up unto the heav'ns,
      which thine own fingers framed,
      Unto the moon, and to the stars,
      which were by thee ordained;

      Then say I, What is man, that he
      remembered is by thee?
      Or what the son of man, that thou
      so kind to him should'st be?

      For thou a little lower hast
      him than the angels made;
      With glory and with dignity
      thou crownèd hast his head.

      Of thy hands' works thou mad'st him lord,
      all under 's feet didst lay;
      All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts
      that in the field do stray;

      Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
      all that pass through the same.
      How excellent in all the earth,
      LORD, our Lord, is thy name!

        This psalm contains a pleasant, but solemn meditation upon the glory,
        the greatness, and the grace of God. Let me here observe, (1.) How
        illustrious and widespread are all his glory and renown, ver. 1, 3, 9.
        (2.) By how weak and insignificant instruments, he manifests and
        spreads his superlative fame, ver. 2. (3.) Behold his marvellous
        condescension and bounty to mankind, but chiefly to the man Christ, in
        uniting his human nature to his divine person, and in giving him all
        power in heaven and earth, for the benefit of his chosen people, ver.
        4-8.<br/><br/><br/> May this Jesus, this name of God in him, be the
        enthroned inhabitant, the everlasting wonder, and the superlative
        darling of my heart. Let me, with the babes of Jerusalem, Matt. 21,
        pour forth my hosannas to him that cometh in the name of the Lord to
        save me - hosannas in the highest. Let all the works of nature lead,
        and excite me to admire their Creator's kindness towards men - towards
        sinful and insignificant me.

      LORD, thee I'll praise with all my heart,
      thy wonders all proclaim.
      In thee, Most High, I'll greatly joy,
      and sing unto thy name.

      When back my foes were turned, they fell,
      and perished at thy sight:
      For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;
      on throne sat'st judging right.

      The heathen thou rebukèd hast,
      the wicked overthrown;
      Thou hast put out their names, that they
      may never more be known.

      O en'my! now destructions have
      an end perpetual:
      Thou cities razed, perished with them
      is their memorial.

      GOD shall endure for aye; he doth
      for judgment set his throne;
      In righteousness to judge the world,
      justice to give each one.

      GOD also will a refuge be
      for those that are oppressed;
      A refuge will he be in times
      of trouble to distressed.

      And they that know thy name, in thee
      their confidence will place:
      For thou hast not forsaken them
      that truly seek thy face.

      O sing ye praises to the LORD
      that dwells in Zion hill;
      And all the nätions among
      his deeds record ye still.

      When he enquireth after blood,
      he then rememb'reth them:
      The humble folk he not forgets
      that call upon his name.

      LORD, pity me; behold the grief
      which I from foes sustain;
      Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death
      dost raise me up again;

      That I, in Zion's daughters' gates,
      may all thy praise advance;
      And that I may rejoice always
      in thy deliverance.

      The heathen are sunk in the pit
      which they themselves prepared;
      And in the net which they have hid
      their own feet fast are snared.

      The LORD is by the judgment known
      which he himself hath wrought:
      The sinners' hands do make the snares
      wherewith themselves are caught.

      They who are wicked into hell
      each one shall turnèd be;
      And all the nations that forget
      to seek the Lord most high.

      For they that needy are shall not
      forgotten be alway;
      The expectation of the poor
      shall not be lost for aye.

      Arise, LORD, let not man prevail;
      judge heathen in thy sight:
      That they may know themselves but men,
      the nations, LORD, affright.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was, perhaps, composed on the occasion of his son Absalom's
        death, 2 Sam. 18; or on the occasion of the death of Goliath the
        champion and duellist of Gath, 1 Sam. 17. We have in it, (1.) David's
        hearty thanksgivings to God, for his pleading of his cause against his
        and his country's enemies, and for giving him a complete victory over
        them, ver. 1-6, and his excitement of others to join with him therein,
        ver. 11-12. (2). His triumph in God as the righteous judge of the
        world, protector of his people, and the destroyer of his implacable
        enemies, ver. 7-10, 15-18. (3.) His requests for further grounds of
        praising God as his own deliverer, and the confounder of his enemies,
        ver. 13-14, 19-20.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these subjects, let me
        chiefly consider the blessings of redemption, the victories of my
        Redeemer over sin, death, and hell; and believe that I, through him,
        shall be more than a conqueror. Let the ruin of transgressors
        effectually admonish me to stand in awe of God, and at the furthest
        distance from sin.

      Wherefore is it that thou, O LORD,
      dost stand from us afar?
      And wherefore hidest thou thyself
      when times so troublous are?

      The wicked in his loftiness
      doth persecute the poor:
      In these devices they have framed
      let them be taken sure.

      The wicked of his heart's desire
      doth talk with boasting great;
      He blesseth him that's covetous,
      whom yet the LORD doth hate.

      The wicked, through his pride of face,
      on God he doth not call;
      And in the counsels of his heart
      the Lord is not at all.

      His ways they always grievous are;
      thy judgments from his sight
      Removèd are: at all his foes
      he puffeth with despite.

      Within his heart he thus hath said,
      I shall not movèd be;
      And no adversity at all
      shall ever come to me.

      His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
      is filled abundantly;
      And underneath his tongue there is
      mischief and vanity.

      He closely sits in villages;
      he slays the innocent:
      Against the poor that pass him by
      his cruel eyes are bent.

      He, lion-like, lurks in his den;
      he waits the poor to take;
      And when he draws him in his net,
      his prey he doth him make.

      Himself he humbleth very low,
      he croucheth down withal,
      That so a multitude of poor
      may by his strong ones fall.

      He thus hath said within his heart,
      The Lord hath quite forgot;
      He hides his countenance, and he
      for ever sees it not.

      O LORD, do thou arise; O God,
      lift up thine hand on high:
      Put not the meek afflicted ones
      out of thy memory.

      Why is it that the wicked man
      thus doth the Lord despise?
      Because that God will it require
      he in his heart denies.

      Thou hast it seen; for their mischief
      and spite thou wilt repay:
      The poor commits himself to thee;
      thou art the orphan's stay.

      The arm break of the wicked man,
      and of the evil one;
      Do thou seek out his wickedness,
      until thou findest none.

      The LORD is king through ages all,
      ev'n to eternity;
      The heathen people from his land
      are perished utterly.

      O LORD, of those that humble are
      thou the desire didst hear;
      Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou
      to hear wilt bend thine ear;

      To judge the fatherless, and those
      that are oppressèd sore;
      That man, that is but sprung of earth,
      may them oppress no more.

    commentary:

        In this psalm of lamentation and woe, we have, (1.) David's mournful
        complaints of God's withdrawment of his gracious and comfortable
        presence, ver. 1. (2.) His mournful and shocking representation of the
        wicked men, who persecuted him, during God's absence: They proudly
        gloried in themselves; they counteracted the laws, and contemned the
        judgments of God; they contradicted and defiled their opposers; they
        were malicious, treacherous, crafty, hypocritical, and atheistical
        persecutors, ver. 2-11. (3.) His earnest supplications for relief to
        the people of God, attended with the firm faith of obtaining it, ver.
        12-18.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these lines, ponder, O my soul, what
        a privilege it is to enjoy familiar fellowship with God! What
        abominations lie hid in an evil heart of unbelief! What a mercy, that
        the Lord hath withheld me from that outrage in wickedness, of which my
        corrupt nature is capable. Let all my views of sins and of judgments
        cause me to flee to Jesus for relief. If he prepare my heart to pray,
        he will surely grant my requests.

        exerting themselves to the uttermost, and all things were in disorder
        and confusion, ver. 1-3. (2.) David baffling the temptation by a
        resolute profession of his trust in God, as the observer of all men;
        as the holy and righteous punisher of the wicked, and friend of the
        godly, ver. 4-7.<br/><br/><br/>Let no temptation decoy me from my

        worst of times. He is ready to help. He will in due time reckon with
        the wicked, and restrain their insolence. He will seasonably and

      Ev'n by my glory; and my flesh
      in confidence shall rest.

      Because my soul in grave to dwell
      shall not be left by thee;
      Nor wilt thou give thine Holy One
      corrüption to see.

      Thou wilt me show the path of life:
      of joys there is full store
      Before thy face; at thy right hand
      are pleasures evermore.

    commentary:

        This psalm is indeed a michtam, a golden psalm. Behold the man
        according to God's heart, (1.) Committing himself to God as his
        preserver, ver. 1. (2.) Avowing his endeared love to the people, and
        strict adherence to the worship of God, ver. 3-4. (3.) With great
        confidence and joy claiming God for his satisfying portion, ver. 2,
        5-7. (4.) Comforting himself in, and blessing God for his present
        intimacy with him, and granting direction to him, and for his certain
        prospect of the eternal enjoyment of him, ver. 8-11.<br/><br/><br/>But
        chiefly behold here, Jesus, the man of God's right hand, surrendering
        himself up to his Father's service, in room of, and for the
        everlasting advantage of his elect! Behold him, taking out his new-
        covenant claim to God, as his God and portion for ever; and as our God
        and portion in him! Behold how, supported of God in his holy manhood,
        he suffers unto a tremendous death, and debased burial; but being
        raised again, he is crowned with everlasting glory and honour! Behold
        how the agonies of suffering, and the pains of death, are succeeded
        with fulness of joy, and rivers of life and pleasures, at God's right
        hand for evermore! Looking to him, let me with patience run the race
        that is set before me, living on, and rejoicing in God, as my all, and
        in all; and looking for the blessed hope, and glorious appearing of
        the great God my Saviour. Through him, neither sin, nor devils, nor
        death, nor hell, shall be able to prevent my immediate and everlasting
        enjoyment of Jehovah, as my infinite portion and exceeding joy.

      LORD, hear the right, attend my cry,
      unto my pray'r give heed,
      That doth not in hypocrisy
      from feignèd lips proceed.

      And from before thy presence forth
      my sentence do thou send:
      Toward these things that equal are
      do thou thine eyes intend.

      Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visit'dst me
      by night, thou didst me try,
      Yet nothing found'st; for that my mouth
      shall not sin, purposed I.

      As for men's works, I, by the word
      that from thy lips doth flow,
      Did me preserve out of the paths
      wherein destroyers go.

      Hold up my goings, Lord, me guide
      in those thy paths divine,
      So that my footsteps may not slide
      out of those ways of thine.

      I callèd have on thee, O God,
      because thou wilt me hear:
      That thou may'st hearken to my speech,
      to me incline thine ear.

      Thy wondrous loving-kindness show,
      thou that, by thy right hand,
      Sav'st them that trust in thee from those
      that up against them stand.

      As th' apple of the eye me keep;
      in thy wings' shade me close
      From lewd oppressors, compassing
      me round, as deadly foes.

      In their own fat they are inclosed;
      their mouth speaks loftily.
      Our steps they compassed; and to ground
      down bowing set their eye.

      He like unto a lion is
      that's greedy of his prey,
      Or lion young, which lurking doth
      in secret places stay.

      Arise, and disappoint my foe,
      and cast him down, O LORD:
      My soul save from the wicked man,
      the man which is thy sword.

      From men, which are thy hand, O LORD,
      from worldly men me save,
      Which only in this present life
      their part and portion have.

      Whose belly with thy treasure hid
      thou fill'st: they children have
      In plenty; of their goods the rest
      they to their children leave.

      But as for me, I thine own face
      in righteousness will see;
      And with thy likeness, when I wake,
      I satisfied shall be.

      Thee will I love, O LORD, my strength.
      My fortress is the LORD,
      My rock, and he that doth to me
      deliverance afford:

      My God, my strength, whom I will trust,
      a buckler unto me,
      The horn of my salvätion,
      and my high tow'r, is he.

      Upon the LORD, who worthy is
      of praises, will I cry;
      And then shall I preservèd be
      safe from mine enemy.

      Floods of ill men affrighted me,
      death's pangs about me went;
      Hell's sorrows me environèd;
      death's snares did me prevent.

      In my distress I called on God,
      cry to my God did I;
      He from his temple heard my voice,
      to his ears came my cry.

      Th' earth, as affrighted, then did shake,
      trembling upon it seized:
      The hills' foundations movèd were,
      because he was displeased.

      Up from his nostrils came a smoke,
      and from his mouth there came
      Devouring fire, and coals by it
      were turnèd into flame.

      He also bowèd down the heav'ns,
      and thence he did descend;
      And thickest clouds of darkness did
      under his feet attend.

      And he upon a cherub rode,
      and thereon he did fly;
      Yea, on the swift wings of the wind
      his flight was from on high.

      He darkness made his secret place:
      about him, for his tent,
      Dark waters were, and thickest clouds
      of th' airy firmament.

      And at the brightness of that light,
      which was before his eye,
      His thick clouds passed away, hailstones
      and coals of fire did fly.

      The LORD God also in the heav'ns
      did thunder in his ire;
      And there the Highest gave his voice,
      hailstones and coals of fire.

      Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,
      and them he scatterèd;
      His lightnings also he shot out,
      and them discomfited.

      The waters' channels then were seen,
      the world's foundations vast
      At thy rebuke discovered were,
      and at thy nostrils' blast.

      And from above the Lord sent down,
      and took me from below;
      From many waters he me drew,
      which would me overflow.

      He me relieved from my strong foes,
      and such as did me hate;
      Because he saw that they for me
      too strong were, and too great.

      They me prevented in the day
      of my calamity;
      But even then the LORD himself
      a stay was unto me.

      He to a place where liberty
      and room was hath me brought;
      Because he took delight in me,
      he my deliv'rance wrought.

      According to my righteousness
      he did me recompense,
      He me repaid according to
      my hands' pure innocence.

      For I GOD's ways kept, from my God
      did not turn wickedly.
        His judgments were before me, I
      his laws put not from me.

      Sincere before him was my heart;
      with him upright was I;
      And watchfully I kept myself
      from mine iniquity.

      After my righteousness the LORD
      hath recompensèd me,
      After the cleanness of my hands
      appearing in his eye.

      Thou gracious to the gracious art,
      to upright men upright:
      Pure to the pure, froward thou kyth'st
      unto the froward wight.

      For thou wilt the afflicted save
      in grief that low do lie:
      But wilt bring down the countenance
      of them whose looks are high.

      The LORD will light my candle so,
      that it shall shine full bright:
      The LORD my God will also make
      my darkness to be light.

      By thee through troops of men I break,
      and them discomfit all;
      And, by my God assisting me,
      I overleap a wall.

      As for God, perfect is his way:
      the LORD his word is tried;
      He is a buckler to all those
      who do in him confide.

      Who but the LORD is God? but he
      who is a rock and stay?
      'Tis God that girdeth me with strength,
      and perfect makes my way.

      He made my feet swift as the hinds,
      set me on my high places.
      Mine hands to war he taught, mine arms
      brake bows of steel in pieces.

      The shield of thy salvätion
      thou didst on me bestow:
      Thy right hand held me up, and great
      thy kindness made me grow.

      And in my way my steps thou hast
      enlargèd under me,
      That I go safely, and my feet
      are kept from sliding free.

      Mine en'mies I pursuèd have,
      and did them overtake;
      Nor did I turn again till I
      an end of them did make.

      I wounded them, they could not rise;
      they at my feet did fall.
      Thou girdest me with strength for war;
      my foes thou brought'st down all:

      And thou hast giv'n to me the necks
      of all mine enemies;
      That I might them destroy and slay,
      who did against me rise.

      They crièd out, but there was none
      that would or could them save;
      Yea, they did cry unto the LORD,
      but he no answer gave.

      Then did I beat them small as dust
      before the wind that flies;
      And I did cast them out like dirt
      upon the street that lies.

      Thou mad'st me free from people's strife,
      and heathen's head to be:
      A people whom I have not known
      shall service do to me.

      At hearing they shall me obey,
      to me they shall submit.
      Strangers for fear shall fade away,
      who in close places sit.

      GOD lives, bless'd be my Rock; the God
      of my health praisèd be.
      God doth avenge me, and subdues
      the people under me.

      He saves me from mine enemies;
      yea, thou hast lifted me
      Above my foes; and from the man
      of vi'lence set me free.

      Therefore to thee will I give thanks
      the heathen folk among;
      And to thy name, O LORD, I will
      sing praises in a song.

      He great deliv'rance gives his king:
      he mercy doth extend
      To David, his anointed one,
      and his seed without end.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        In this psalm of thanksgiving for manifold deliverances, observe, (1.)
        David's ardent love to God in Christ, whom he believed to be his own,
        in every gracious and saving relation; and whom he had experienced his
        merciful, almighty, and seasonable deliverer, from depths of trouble,
        ver. 1-19. (2.) His comfortable reflections, on the integrity which
        the Lord had enabled him to maintain, and on the gracious kindness of
        God, consequential thereupon, ver. 20-28. (3.) His thankful ascription
        of all the glory of his noted exploits to God, as his director and
        strengthener, ver. 29-42. (4.) His triumphant faith and hope, of
        further assistance and favour from God, to himself and to his seed for
        evermore, ver. 43-50.<br/><br/><br/>But let me not forget Jesus, to
        whom Jehovah is so closely, so marvellously, so sweetly related:
        Jesus, who so ardently loveth his eternal Father, and for ever returns
        the grateful remembrance of his kindness to him, and to his chosen
        seed, in delivering him from distress; in raising him from the dead;
        in rewarding his obedience unto death, in giving him glory at his own
        right hand, and in rendering all nations his obedient subjects. Let me
        sing this new song, in the full assurance of faith, that God in Christ
        is my all and in all; and with a heart ravished with the consolations
        of Christ, and in the sweet reviews of what he hath done, what he
        doth, and what he will for ever do, for my soul.

      The heav'ns God's glory do declare,
      the skies his hand-works preach:
      Day utters speech to day, and night
      to night doth knowledge teach.

      There is no speech nor tongue to which
      their voice doth not extend:
      Their line is gone through all the earth,
      their words to the world's end.

      In them he set the sun a tent;
      Who, bridegroom-like, forth goes
      From's chamber, as a strong man doth
      to run his race rejoice.

      From heav'n's end is his going forth,
      circling to th' end again;
      And there is nothing from his heat
      that hidden doth remain.

      GOD's law is perfect, and converts
      the soul in sin that lies:
      GOD's testimony is most sure,
      and makes the simple wise.

      The statutes of the LORD are right,
      and do rejoice the heart:
      The LORD's command is pure, and doth
      light to the eyes impart.

      Unspotted is the fear of GOD,
      and doth endure for ever:
      The judgments of the LORD are true
      and righteous altogether.

      They more than gold, yea, much fine gold,
      to be desirèd are:
      Than honey, honey from the comb
      that droppeth, sweeter far.

      Moreover, they thy servant warn
      how he his life should frame:
      A great reward provided is
      for them that keep the same.

      Who can his errors understand?
      O cleanse thou me within
      From secret faults. Thy servant keep
      from all presumptuous sin:

      And do not suffer them to have
      dominion over me:
      Then rïghteous and innocent
      I from much sin shall be.

      The words which from my mouth proceed,
      the thoughts sent from my heart,
      Accept, O LORD, for thou my strength
      and my Redeemer art.

        Now the books of God are opened, not for my trial and condemnation in
        the last judgment, but for my instruction. Let my soul look and read
        therein - (1.) The book of creation and providence, in which all the
        works of God instruct mankind in general, concerning the eternal
        wisdom, power and goodness, of their Maker, ver. 1-6. (2.) The book of
        inspiration; the sure, the right, the pure, the true, the perfect and
        powerful oracles of which instruct, convert, comfort, and warm the
        members of the church; and in keeping of which there is an exceeding
        great and everlasting reward of glory obtained, ver. 7-11. (3.) What
        conviction of sin! what supplication for pardon of it, and
        preservation from it! and for the acceptance of our duties through
        Jesus' blood, doth or ought to ensue upon a proper perusal of these
        volumes of heaven, ver. 12-14.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these
        matters, let me, conscious of my own ignorance and folly, in all
        things consult the mind of God. Let me blush that my experience of the
        powerful influences of God's word is so scanty; and that in me, still
        dwell such fearful remains of sinful corruption. Let me cry mightily
        to God, for the subduing and destruction thereof.

      My God, my God, why hast thou me
      forsaken? why so far
      Art thou from helping me, and from
      my words that roaring are?

      All day, my God, to thee I cry,
      yet am not heard by thee;
      And in the season of the night
      I cannot silent be.

      But thou art holy, thou that dost
      inhabit Isr'el's praise.
      Our fathers hoped in thee, they hoped,
      and thou didst them release.

      When unto thee they sent their cry,
      to them deliv'rance came:
      Because they put their trust in thee,
      they were not put to shame.

      But as for me, a worm I am,
      and as no man am prized:
      Reproach of men I am, and by
      the people am despised.

      All that me see laugh me to scorn;
      shoot out the lip do they;
      They nod and shake their heads at me,
      and, mocking, thus do say,

      This man did trust in GOD, that he
      would free him by his might:
      Let him deliver him, sith he
      had in him such delight.

      But thou art he out of the womb
      that didst me safely take;
      When I was on my mother's breasts
      thou me to hope didst make.

      And I was cast upon thy care,
      ev'n from the womb till now;
      And from my mother's belly, Lord,
      my God and guide art thou.

      Be not far off, for grief is near,
      and none to help is found.
      Bulls many compass me, strong bulls
      of Bashan me surround.

      Their mouths they opened wide on me,
      upon me gape did they,
      Like to a lion ravening
      and roaring for his prey.

      Like water I'm poured out, my bones
      all out of joint do part:
      Amidst my bowels, as the wax,
      so melted is my heart.

      My strength is like a potsherd dried;
      my tongue it cleaveth fast
      Unto my jaws; and to the dust
      of death thou brought me hast.

      For dogs have compassed me about:
      the wicked, that did meet
      In their assembly, me inclosed;
      they pierced my hands and feet.

      I all my bones may tell; they do
      upon me look and stare.
      Upon my vesture lots they cast,
      and clothes among them share.

      But be not far, O LORD, my strength;
      haste to give help to me.
      From sword my soul, from pow'r of dogs
      my darling set thou free.

      Out of the roaring lion's mouth
      do thou me shield and save:
      For from the horns of unicorns
      an ear to me thou gave.

      I will show forth thy name unto
      those that my brethren are;
      Amidst the congregätion
      thy praise I will declare.

      Praise ye the LORD, who do him fear;
      him glorify all ye
      The seed of Jacob: fear him all
      that Isr'el's children be.

      For he despised not nor abhorred
      th' afflicted's misery;
      Nor from him hid his face, but heard
      when he to him did cry.

      Within the congregation great
      my praise shall be of thee;
      My vows before them that him fear
      shall be performed by me.

      The meek shall eat, and shall be filled;
      they also praise shall give
      Unto the LORD that do him seek:
      your heart shall ever live.

      All ends of th' earth remember shall,
      and turn the LORD unto;
      All kindreds of the nätions
      to him shall homage do:

      Because the kingdom to the LORD
      doth appertain as his;
      Likewise among the nätions
      the Governor he is.

      Earth's fat ones eat, and worship shall:
      all who to dust descend
      Shall bow to him; none of them can
      his soul from death defend.

      A seed shall service do to him;
      unto the Lord it shall
      Be for a generätion
      reckoned in ages all.

      They shall come, and they shall declare
      his truth and righteousness
      Unto a people yet unborn,
      and that he hath done this.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Here the debasement and exaltation of David, king of Israel, are
        merely subservient to, and figurative of the debasement and exaltation
        of Jesus Christ, our blessed Aijeleth Shahar, Hind of the
        Morning<br/><br/><br/>I. In this deep debasement we find, (1.) Bitter,
        but kindly and believing, complaints of God's withdrawment; attended
        with earnest attempts of faith to quiet the complainer's soul under
        it, drawn from the consideration of God's holiness and highness, and
        his seasonable deliverance of his people in former times, when they
        cried to him, ver. 1-5. (2.) Bitter complaints of men's reproaches and
        contemptuous derision; attended with self encouragements, drawn from
        former experience of God's early and seasonable care and friendship,
        ver. 6-10. (3.) Bitter complaints of the number and rage of enemies,
        attended with exquisite agonies of body and mind, and mingled with
        earnest prayers for God's speedy supports, assistance, and powerful
        deliverance, ver. 11-21.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these, let me
        behold the vileness, the criminality, the destructive influence of
        sin! Let me behold the sovereignty of God, who not only scourgeth
        every son whom he receiveth, but spared not his only begotten Son, but
        delivered him up for us all! Behold, how he hates, how he punisheth
        our sin! And what manner of love he bestowed upon us, that we might be
        called the sons of God! Behold, how he commendeth his love unto us, in
        that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us! And if Jesus,
        with patience bore such desertion, reproach, and distress; let me, in
        the firm faith that he did all for me, and that God is mine, and
        maketh all things work for my good, study an unhampered resignation to
        his will.<br/><br/><br/>II. By the typical exaltation of David, and
        the increase, happiness, honour, and duration of his kingdom, we have
        prefigured the glorious exaltation of our Redeemer; importing, that he
        should have a church among men; that his Father should be glorified in
        them as well as in him; that his true subjects should abound in
        prayer, praise, spiritual comfort, and everlasting life; and that his
        church should be enlarged with multitudes of both Jews and Gentiles,
        and should, to his honour, and for his worship and service, continue
        to all generations, ver. 22-31.<br><br/><br/>While I sing this, let me
        trust, and rejoice in, and plead his promises, relative to myself and
        his church. Let me ponder, whether I have heard his voice, shared his
        saving pity, feasted on his spiritual provision, and worshipped him in
        spirit, and in truth! And whether it is the desire of my soul to cause
        his name to be remembered to all generations.

      The LORD's my shepherd, I'll not want.
      He makes me down to lie
      In pastures green: he leadeth me
      the quiet waters by.

      My soul he doth restore again;
      and me to walk doth make
      Within the paths of righteousness,
      ev'n for his own name's sake.

      Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
      yet will I fear none ill:
      For thou art with me; and thy rod
      and staff me comfort still.

      My table thou hast furnishèd
      in presence of my foes;
      My head thou dost with oil anoint,
      and my cup overflows.

      Goodness and mercy all my life
      shall surely follow me:
      And in GOD's house for evermore
      my dwelling-place shall be.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Here is the children's psalm, and which is, in very deed, a noted song
        of all the children of God. Behold, (1.) New-covenant relation to God,
        as a full and everlasting security against hurtful wants, ver. 1. (2.)
        Pleasant experience of God's acting up to his new-covenant character,
        in disposing of, directing, assisting, feasting and comforting his
        people, ver. 2-3, 5. (3.) Well-grounded hopes of God's careful and
        seasonable supplies; of his comfortable presence and help amidst
        distress and death; of the perpetual and everlasting manifestation of
        his mercy and grace to us-ward; and of our endless nearness to, and
        immediate enjoyment of him, ver. 1, 4, 5-6.<br/><br/><br/>While I
        sing, let me think, as before God, whether I have the experimental
        knowledge of all these things. Let my soul be as a daughter of the
        horse-leech, crying mightily, Give, give what is good. And let me, in
        all these forms, taste and see that God is good.

      The earth belongs unto the LORD,
      and all that it contains;
      The world that is inhabited,
      and all that there remains.

      For the foundätions thereof
      he on the seas did lay,
      And he hath it establishèd
      upon the floods to stay.

      Who is the man that shall ascend
      into the hill of GOD?
      Or who within his holy place
      shall have a firm abode?

      Whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure,
      and unto vanity
      Who hath not lifted up his soul,
      nor sworn deceitfully.

      He from th' ETERNAL shall receive
      the blessing him upon,
      And righteousness, ev'n from the God
      of his salvätion.

      This is the generätion
      that after him enquire,
      O Jacob, who do seek thy face
      with their whole heart's desire.

      Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
      ye doors that last for aye,
      Be lifted up, that so the King
      of glory enter may.

      But who of glory is the King?
      The mighty LORD is this;
      Ev'n that same LORD, that great in might
      and strong in battle is.

      Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye doors,
      doors that do last for aye,
      Be lifted up, that so the King
      of glory enter may.

      But who is he that is the King
      of glory? who is this?
      The LORD of hosts, and none but he,
      the King of glory is.

        Probably this psalm was penned for use of the Hebrews, when David
        brought up the ark of God to Jerusalem, or when Solomon brought it
        into the temple, 2 Sam. 6, 1 Kings 8, in order to raise their hearts
        above their external ceremonies, to a reception of, and walking in
        Christ, who was thereby prefigured. Observe, (1.) Christ's kingdom of
        nature, comprehending the whole world and all the inhabitants thereof,
        ver. 1-2. (2.) His kingdom of grace in the nature of it; the gracious
        character of its subjects; and their charter to their everlasting
        happiness above, ver. 3-6. (3.) Under the figure of a call to admit
        the ark, we have a solemn summons, issued forth by God, for the
        heavens to receive Jesus, our glorious and almighty King, into their
        blissful abodes in his ascension; and for us to receive him into our
        hearts and societies below, ver. 7-10.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let
        me be affected with the double claim the Redeemer hath on me - as his
        creature, and as his ransomed one. Let me try whether I possess the
        distinguishing characters of a real saint; and whether I have received
        an abundance of the gift of righteousness, and of blessedness from the
        God of my salvation. Let me charge, let me rouse up all my inward
        powers, to receive Jesus Christ the Lord, as made of God unto me,
        wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.

      To thee I lift my soul:
      O LORD, I trust in thee:
      My God, let me not be asham'd,
      nor foes triumph o'er me.

      Let none that wait on thee
      be put to shame at all;
      But those that without cause transgress,
      let shame upon them fall.

      Show me thy ways, O LORD;
      thy paths, O teach thou me:
      And do thou lead me in thy truth,
      therein my teacher be:

      For thou art God that dost
      to me salvation send,
      And I upon thee all the day
      expecting do attend.

      Thy tender mercies, LORD,
      I pray thee to remember,
      And loving-kindnesses; for they
      have been of old for ever.

      My sins and faults of youth
      do thou, O LORD, forget:
      After thy mercy think on me,
      and for thy goodness great.

      GOD good and upright is:
      the way he'll sinners show.
      The meek in judgment he will guide,
      and make his path to know.

      The whole paths of the LORD
      are truth and mercy sure,
      To those that do his cov'nant keep,
      and testimonies pure.

      Now, for thine own name's sake,
      O LORD, I thee entreat
      To pardon mine iniquity;
      for it is very great.

      What man is he that fears
      the LORD, and doth him serve?
      Him shall he teach the way that he
      shall choose, and still observe.

      His soul shall dwell at ease;
      and his posterity
      Shall flourish still, and of the earth
      inheritors shall be.

      With those that fear him is
      the secret of the LORD;
      The knowledge of his covènant
      he will to them afford.

      Mine eyes upon the LORD
      continually are set;
      For he it is that shall bring forth
      my feet out of the net.

      Turn unto me thy face,
      and to me mercy show;
      Because that I am desolate,
      and am brought very low.

      My heart's griefs are increased:
      me from distress relieve.
      See mine affliction and my pain,
      and all my sins forgive.

      Consider thou my foes,
      because they many are;
      And it a cruel hatred is
      which they against me bear.

      O do thou keep my soul,
      do thou deliver me:
      And let me never be ashamed,
      because I trust in thee.

      Let uprightness and truth

        In singing this psalm, let me observe, (1.) What serious work prayer
        is; what lifting up of soul, what directing of eyes to God, and fixing
        them on him, must be in it! ver. 1-15. (2.) What mercies ought to be
        prayed for Pardon of sin, ver. 6, 7-18; direction in duty, ver. 4-5;
        familiar intimacy with God, ver. 10; deliverance from trouble, ver.
        17-18; preservation from adversaries, ver. 20-21; and, in fine, safety
        and deliverance to the church, ver. 22. (3.)What pleas are proper to
        be used in prayer; as, the trust we have reposed in God, ver. 2-3,
        5-21; our own divinely affected sincerity in the Lord's way, ver. 21;
        our distress, and the malice of our enemies, ver. 2, 16-19; but
        chiefly, the mercy that is in God, and the glory which redounds to his
        name from his bestowing of new-covenant favours, ver. 6-11. (4.)
        Strong encouragements to prayer - taken from the perfections of God's
        nature; from his promises of instruction and direction; from the
        fulness and grace of his covenant; and from his delight in allowing
        men familiar intimacy and fellowship with himself, ver.
        8-14.<br/><br/><br/>Let these things, my soul, be the object of thy
        strictest care and attention, in all thy addresses to God.

        instituted ordinances: and his fixed aversion to sin and sinners, ver.
        1-8. (2.) He deprecates from himself, the condemnation of the wicked,
        and his being shut up in society with them, ver. 9-10. (3.) Depending
        on the mercy of God, he resolves to hold fast his integrity, and
        maintain his confident hopes of eternal life, ver.
        11-12.<br/><br/><br/> While I sing, let the perfect God-man come into
        my mind. Let me wash myself in his blood, and so compass God's altar
        with songs of praise for his favours. Making Jesus' example my
        pattern, let his ordinances be my pleasure, and his people my sole
        intimates and familiars on earth.

      The LORD's my light and saving health,
      who shall make me dismayed?
      My life's strength is the LORD, of whom
      then shall I be afraid?

      When as mine enemies and foes,
      most wicked persons all,
      To eat my flesh against me rose,
      they stumbled and did fall.

      Against me though an host encamp,
      my heart yet fearless is:
      Though war against me rise, I will
      be confident in this.

      One thing I of the LORD desired,
      and will seek to obtain,
      That all days of my life I may
      within GOD's house remain;

      That I the beauty of the LORD
      behold may and admire,
      And that I in his holy place
      may rev'rently enquire.

      For he in his pavilion shall
      me hide in evil days;
      In secret of his tent me hide,
      and on a rock me raise.

      And now, ev'n at this present time,
      mine head shall lifted be
      Above all those that are my foes,
      and round encompass me:

      Therefore unto his tabernacle
      I'll sacrifices bring
      Of joyfulness; I'll sing, yea, I
      to GOD will praises sing.

      O LORD, give ear unto my voice,
      when I do cry to thee;
      Upon me also mercy have,
      and do thou answer me.

      When thou didst say, Seek ye my face,
      then unto thee reply
      Thus did my heart, Above all things
      thy face, LORD, seek will I.

      Far from me hide not thou thy face;
      put not away from thee
      Thy servant in thy wrath: thou hast
      an helper been to me.

      O God of my salvätion,
      leave me not, nor forsake:
      Though me my parents both should leave,
      the LORD will me up take.

      O LORD, instruct me in thy way,
      to me a leader be
      In a plain path, because of those
      that hatred bear to me.

      Give me not to mine en'mies' will;
      for witnesses that lie
      Against me risen are, and such
      as breathe out cruelty.

      I fainted had, unless that I
      believèd had to see
      The LORD's own goodness in the land
      of them that living be.

      Wait on the LORD, and be thou strong,
      and he shall strength afford
      Unto thine heart; yea, do thou wait,
      I say, upon the LORD.

      When to thine holy oracle

      With ill men draw me not away

      The LORD's my strength and shield; my heart

      Their strength is GOD alone:
      He also is the saving strength
      of his anointed one.

        carnal security, under prosperity, had occasioned his sudden fall into
        divine hidings and frowns, ver. 6-7. (4.) He recollects what
        supplications he had made to God, in his former distress, ver. 8-10.

      Bow down thine ear to me, with speed
      send me deliverance:
      To save me, my strong rock be thou,
      and my house of defence.

      Because thou art my rock, and thee
      I for my fortress take;
      Therefore do thou me lead and guide,
      ev'n for thine own name's sake.

      And sith thou art my strength, therefore
      pull me out of the net,
      Which they in subtlety for me
      so privily have set.

      Into thine hands I do commit
      my spirit: for thou art he,
      O thou, JEHOVAH, God of truth,
      that hast redeemèd me.

      Those that do lying vanities
      regard, I have abhorred:
      But as for me, my confidence
      is fixèd on the LORD.

      I'll in thy mercy gladly joy:

      And thou hast not inclosèd me
      within the en'my's hand;

      in a large room to stand.

      O LORD, upon me mercy have,
      for trouble is on me:
      Mine eye, my belly, and my soul,
      with grief consumèd be.

      Because my life with grief is spent,
      my years with sighs and groans:
      My strength doth fail; and for my sin
      consumèd are my bones.

      I was a scorn to all my foes,
      and to my friends a fear;
      And specially reproached of those
      that were my neighbours near:

      When they me saw they from me fled.
      Ev'n so I am forgot,
      As men are out of mind when dead:
      I'm like a broken pot.

      For slanders I of many heard;
      fear compassed me, while they
      Against me did consult, and plot
      to take my life away.

      But as for me, O LORD, my trust
      upon thee I did lay;
      And I to thee, Thou art my God,
      did confidently say.

      My times are wholly in thine hand:
      do thou deliver me
      From their hands that mine enemies
      and persecutors be.

      Thy countenance to shine do thou
      upon thy servant make:
      Unto me give salvätion,
      for thy great mercies' sake.

      Let me not be ashamed, O LORD,
      for on thee called I have:
      Let wicked men be shamed, let them
      be silent in the grave.

      To silence put the lying lips,
      that grievous things do say,
      And hard reports, in pride and scorn,
      on righteous men do lay.

      How great's the goodness thou for them
      that fear thee keep'st in store,
      And wrought'st for them that trust in thee
      the sons of men before!

      In secret of thy presence thou
      shalt hide them from man's pride:
      From strife of tongues thou closely shalt,
      as in a tent, them hide.

      All praise and thanks be to the LORD;
      for he hath magnified
      His wondrous love to me within
      a city fortified.

      For from thine eyes cut off I am,
      I in my haste had said;
      My voice yet heard'st thou, when to thee
      with cries my moan I made.

      O love the LORD, all ye his saints;
      because the LORD doth guard
      The faithful, and he plenteously
      proud doers doth reward.

      Be of good courage, and he strength
      unto your heart shall send,

      doth on the LORD depend.

        dangers, and direction in duty, ver. 1-2, 7-8. (2.) The indispensable
        duty of them who desire new-covenant blessings; viz. to acknowledge
        their offences to God; to implore his favour, which they need; to walk
        humbly and circumspectly before him, and to rejoice in him as God and
        their God, ver. 3-6, 9-11.<br/><br/><br/>While I am truly conscious of

      it was without delay;
      Establishèd it firmly stood,
      whatever he did say.

      GOD doth the counsel bring to nought
      which heathen folk do take;
      And what the people do devise
      of none effect doth make.

      O but the counsel of the LORD
      doth stand for ever sure;
      And of his heart the purposes
      from age to age endure.

      That nation blessèd is, whose God
      JEHOVAH is, and those
      A blessèd people are, whom for

      The LORD from heav'n sees and beholds
      all sons of men full well:
      He views all from his dwelling-place
      that in the earth do dwell.

      He forms their hearts alike, and all
      their doings he observes.
      Great hosts save not a king, much strength
      no mighty man preserves.

      An horse for preservätion
      is a deceitful thing;
      And by the greatness of his strength
      can no deliv'rance bring.

      Behold, on those that do him fear
      the LORD doth set his eye;
      Ev'n those who on his mercy do
      with confidence rely.

      From death to free their soul, in dearth
      life unto them to yield.
      Our soul doth wait upon the LORD;
      he is our help and shield.

      Sith in his holy name we trust,
      our heart shall joyful be.
      LORD, let thy mercy be on us,
      as we do hope in thee.

      GOD will I bless all times; his praise
      my mouth shall still express.
      My soul shall boast in GOD: the meek
      shall hear with joyfulness.

      Extol the LORD with me, let us
      exalt his name together.
      I sought the LORD, he heard, and did
      me from all fears deliver.

      They looked to him, and lightened were:
      not shamèd were their faces.
      This poor man cried, GOD heard, and saved
      him from all his distresses.

      The angel of the LORD encamps,
      and round encompasseth
      All those about that do him fear,
      and them delivereth.

      O taste and see that GOD is good:
      who trusts in him is blessed.
      Fear GOD his saints: none that him fear
      shall be with want oppressed.

      The lions young may hungry be,
      and they may lack their food:
      But they that truly seek the LORD
      shall not lack any good.

      O children, hither do ye come,
      and unto me give ear;
      I shall you teach to understand
      how ye the LORD should fear.

      What man is he that life desires,
      to see good would live long?
      Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,
      and from ill words thy tongue.

      Depart from ill, do good, seek peace,
      pursue it earnestly.
      GOD's eyes are on the just; his ears
      are open to their cry.

      The face of GOD is set against
      those that do wickedly,
      That he may quite out from the earth
      cut off their memory.

      The righteous cry unto the LORD,
      he unto them gives ear;
      And they out of their troubles all
      by him delivered are.

      The LORD is ever nigh to them
      that be of broken spirit;
      To them he safety doth afford
      that are in heart contrite.

      The troubles that afflict the just
      in number many be;
      But yet at length out of them all
      the LORD doth set him free.

      He carefully his bones doth keep,
      whatever can befall;
      That not so much as one of them
      can broken be at all.

      Ill shall the wicked slay; laid waste
      shall be who hate the just.
      The LORD redeems his servants' souls;
      none perish that him trust.

        This psalm was composed by David, when Achish, or Abimelech, king of
        Gath, drove him from his court as an idiot or madman, 1 Sam. 21:10-15.
        Here are, (1.) David's high praises to God, for the favours himself
        and others had received, ver. 1-6. (2.) His warm invitations and
        strong encouragements to others to seek after and fear the Lord, and
        to trust in him for all necessary supplies, in time, or in eternity,
        ver. 7-10. (3.) Familiar advice to children and others to eschew every
        thing sinful, and make conscience of known duty, both towards God and
        man, as a means of present and future happiness, ver. 11-14. (4.) A
        representation of the misery of the wicked, in having God against them
        as an avenging enemy, and in having ruin before them as the just
        reward of their sins; and of the happiness of the godly, in having God
        near to them in every case, ready to hear their requests, to protect
        them amidst dangers, and to deliver them from enemies and trouble,
        ver. 15-22.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let my heart be warmed with my
        subject. Come my soul, and walk in this light, in these joys of the
        Lord: Come, taste and see that he is good; extol his kindness, and
        trust him in all things, and on every occasion.

      Plead, LORD, with those that plead; and fight
      with those that fight with me.
      Of shield and buckler take thou hold,

      Draw also out the spear, and do
      against them stop the way
      That me pursue: unto my soul,
      I'm thy salvation, say.

      Let them confounded be and shamed
      that for my soul have sought:
      Who plot my hurt turned back be they,
      and to confusion brought.

      Let them be like unto the chaff
      that flies before the wind;
      And let the angel of the LORD

      With darkness cover thou their way,
      and let it slipp'ry prove;
      And let the angel of the LORD
      pursue them from above.

      For without cause have they for me
      their net hid in a pit,
      They also have without a cause

      Let ruin seize him unawares;

      Which dost the poor set free from him
      that is for him too strong;
      The poor and needy from the man
      that spoils and does him wrong?

      False witnesses rose; to my charge
      things I not knew they laid.
      They, to the spoiling of my soul,
      me ill for good repaid.

      But as for me, when they were sick,
      in sackcloth sad I mourned:
      My humbled soul did fast, my prayer
      into my bosom turned.

      Myself I did behave as he
      had been my friend or brother;
      I heavily bowed down, as one
      that mourneth for his mother.

      But in my trouble they rejoiced,
      gath'ring themselves together;
      Yea, abjects vile together did
      themselves against me gather:

      I knew it not; they did me tear,
      and quiet would not be.
      With mocking hypocrites, at feasts
      they gnashed their teeth at me.

      How long, Lord, look'st thou on? from those
      destructions they intend
      Rescue my soul, from lions young
      my darling do defend.

      I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,
      within th' assembly great;
      And where much people gathered are
      thy praises forth will set.

      Let not my wrongful enemies
      proudly rejoice o'er me;
      Nor who me hate without a cause,
      let them wink with the eye.

      For peace they do not speak at all;
      but crafty plots prepare
      Against all those within the land
      that meek and quiet are.

      With mouths set wide, they 'gainst me said,
      Ha, ha! our eye doth see.
      LORD, thou hast seen, hold not thy peace;
      Lord, be not far from me.

      Stir up thyself; wake, that thou may'st
      judgment to me afford,
      Ev'n to my cause, O thou that art
      my only God and Lord.

      O LORD my God, do thou me judge
      after thy righteousness;
      And let them not their joy 'gainst me
      triumphantly express:

      Nor let them say within their hearts,
      Ah, we would have it thus;
      Nor suffer them to say, that he
      is swallowed up by us.

      Shamed and confounded be they all
      that at my hurt are glad;
      Let those against me that do boast
      with shame and scorn be clad.

      Let them that love my righteous cause
      be glad, shout, and not cease
      To say, The LORD be magnified,
      who loves his servant's peace.

      Thy righteousness shall also be
      declarèd by my tongue;
      The praises that belong to thee
      speak shall it all day long.

        In this psalm, (1.) David, as a type of Christ, complains of the
        cruelty of his enemies, in striving with him, in persecuting him, in
        seeking his ruin, and in reproaching, contemning, deriding, and
        triumphing over him, ver. 1, 3-4, 7, 11, 15-16, 20-21, 25-26. (2.) He
        pleads his own innocency, that he had never given them any
        provocation; but, amidst their abuse of him, had earnestly and
        affectionately studied to promote their welfare, ver. 7, 9, 12-14.
        (3.) He supplicates that God would espouse his cause, protect,
        deliver, and comfort his soul, defeat the designs, and disappoint the
        expectations of his enemies; and that he would countenance and
        encourage his friends, ver. 1-2, 4, 17, 22-27. (4.) He predicts the
        destruction of his enemies, and the abounding of his own comfort; and
        in the views hereof, resolves to thank and praise the Lord, ver. 4-10,
        18, 28.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me, with grief and shame, call
        to mind the infernal opposition, I and others have made to our all
        -compassionate Redeemer. Let me beware of exposing myself to that
        vengeance, which is laid up in store for his incorrigible enemies. Let
        me never avenge myself on my injurious neighbours: But amidst all
        attacks from hell or earth, or from my own corrupt heart, let me
        commit all my concerns to him who judgeth righteously, that he may
        bring them to pass.

      The wicked man's transgrëssion
      within my heart thus says,
      Undoubtedly the fear of God
      is not before his eyes.

      Because himself he flattereth
      in his own blinded eye,
      Until the hatefulness be found
      of his iniquity.

      Words from his mouth proceeding are,
      fraud and iniquity:
      He to be wise, and to do good,
      hath left off utterly.

      He mischief, lying on his bed,
      most cunningly doth plot:
      He sets himself in ways not good,
      ill he abhorreth not.

      Thy mercy, LORD, is in the heav'ns;
      thy truth doth reach the clouds:
      Thy justice is like mountains great;
      thy judgments deep as floods:

      LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
      How precious is thy grace!
      Therefore in shadow of thy wings
      men's sons their trust shall place.

      They with the fatness of thy house
      shall be well satisfied;
      From rivers of thy pleasures thou
      wilt drink to them provide.

      Because of life the fountain pure
      remains alone with thee;
      And in that purest light of thine
      we clearly light shall see.

      Thy loving-kindness unto them
      continue that thee know;
      And still on men upright in heart
      thy righteousness bestow.

      Let not the foot of cruel pride
      come, and against me stand;
      And let me not removèd be,
      Lord, by the wicked's hand.

      There fall'n are they, and ruinèd,

      For evildoers fret thou not
      thyself unquietly;
      Nor do thou envy bear to those
      that work iniquity.

      For, even like unto the grass,
      soon be cut down shall they;
      And, like the green and tender herb,
      they wither shall away.

      Set thou thy trust upon the LORD,
      and be thou doing good;
      And so thou in the land shalt dwell,
      and verily have food.

      Delight thyself in GOD; he'll give
      thine heart's desire to thee.
      Thy way to GOD commit, him trust,
      it bring to pass shall he.

      And, like unto the light, he shall
      thy righteousness display;
      And he thy judgment shall bring forth
      like noon-tide of the day.

      Rest in the LORD, and patiently
      wait for him: do not fret
      For him who, prosp'ring in his way,
      success in sin doth get.

      Do thou from anger cease, and wrath
      see thou forsake also:
      Fret not thyself in any wise,
      that evil thou should'st do.

      For those that evildoers are
      shall be cut off and fall:
      But those that wait upon the LORD
      the earth inherit shall.

      For yet a little while, and then
      the wicked shall not be;
      His place thou shalt consider well,
      but it thou shalt not see.

      But by inheritance the earth
      the meek ones shall possess:
      They also shall delight themselves
      in an abundant peace.

      The wicked plots against the just,
      and at him whets his teeth:
      The Lord shall laugh at him, because
      his day he coming seeth.

      The wicked have drawn out the sword,
      and bent their bow, to slay
      The poor and needy, and to kill
      men of an upright way.

      But their own sword, which they have drawn,
      shall enter their own heart:
      Their bows which they have bent shall break,
      and into pieces part.

      A little that a just man hath
      is more and better far
      Than is the wealth of many such
      as lewd and wicked are.

      For sinners' arms shall broken be;
      but GOD the just sustains.
      GOD knows the just man's days, and still
      their heritage remains.

      They shall not be ashamed when they
      the evil time do see;
      And when the days of famine are,
      they satisfied shall be.

      But wicked men, and foes of GOD,
      as fat of lambs, decay;
      They shall consume, yea, into smoke
      they shall consume away.

      The wicked borrows, but the same
      again he doth not pay;
      Whereas the righteous mercy shows,
      and gives his own away.

      For such as blessèd be of him
      the earth inherit shall;
      And they that cursèd are of him
      shall be destroyèd all.

      A good man's footsteps by the LORD
      are orderèd aright;
      And in the way wherein he walks
      he greatly doth delight.

      Although he fall, yet shall he not
      be cast down utterly,
      Because the LORD with his own hand
      upholds him mightily.

      I have been young, and now am old,
      yet have I never seen
      The just man left, nor that his seed
      for bread have beggars been.

      He's ever merciful, and lends:
      his seed is blessed therefore.
      Depart from evil, and do good,
      and dwell for evermore.

      For GOD loves judgment, and his saints
      leaves not in any case;
      They are kept ever; but cut off
      shall be the sinner's face.

      The just inherit shall the land,
      and ever in it dwell:
      The just man's mouth doth wisdom speak;
      his tongue doth judgment tell.

      In 's heart the law is of his God,
      his steps slide not away.
      The wicked man doth watch the just,
      and seeketh him to slay.

      Yet him the LORD will not forsake,
      nor leave him in his hands:
      The righteous will he not condemn,
      when he in judgment stands.

      Wait on the LORD, and keep his way,
      and thee exalt shall he
      Th' earth to inherit; when cut off
      the wicked thou shalt see.

      I saw the wicked great in power,
      spread like a green bay-tree:
      He passed, yea, was not; him I sought,
      but found he could not be.

      Mark thou the perfect, and behold
      the man of uprightness,
      Because that surely of this man
      the latter end is peace.

      But those men that transgressors are
      shall be destroyed together;
      The latter end of wicked men
      shall be cut off for ever.

      But the salvation of the just
      is from the LORD above;
      He in the time of their distress
      their stay and strength doth prove.

      The LORD shall help, and them deliver:
      he shall them free and save
      From wicked men, because in him
      their confidence they have.

    commentary:

        This psalm is wholly of the instructive kind. As the Mosaic system,
        and the covenant between God and Israel, as his peculiar people,
        promised remarkable temporal felicity to such as were obedient to the
        law, and denounced temporal miseries against those that were impious
        and profane; so the psalmist here cautions against stumbling at
        particular providences, which might appear contrary to the tenour of
        that covenant. Here are, (1.) Plain and express warnings against
        fretfulness at the prosperity of the wicked, in their wickedness, ver.
        1, 7-8; with the arguments and reasons enforcing the same, viz. that
        the character of the wicked is ignominious, while that of the
        righteous is honourable, ver. 12, 14, 21, 26, 30-32; that the wicked,
        in the very height of their prosperity, are near to destruction, while
        the righteous, even in their adversity, have special protection from
        God, and shall never be ruined, ver. 2, 9-10, 13, 15, 17, 20, 28,
        33-40; and that God hath special blessings in store for, and even in
        this life manifests distinguished kindness to, the righteous and their
        seed, ver. 11, 16, 18-19, 22-25, 28-29, 37. (2.) Here are proper and
        effectual remedies to prevent sinful fretting at the prosperity of the
        wicked, or troubles of the godly, viz. hoping in God as our Saviour;
        delighting in God as our companion, friend and portion; following him
        as our guide; departing from evil and doing good; waiting on the Lord,
        and keeping his way, ver. 3-6, 27, 34.<br/><br/><br/>Be thou, my soul,
        an accurate observer, of the matter and circumstances of every
        providence. Carefully compare them one with another; and all with
        perfections, covenant, and promises of God; in order that thou mayest
        never be offended thereat.

      In thy great indignätion,
      O LORD, rebuke me not;
      Nor on me lay thy chast'ning hand,
      in thy displeasure hot.

      For in me fast thine arrows stick,
      thine hand doth press me sore:
      And in my flesh there is no health,
      nor soundness any more.

      This grief I have, because thy wrath
      is forth against me gone;
      And in my bones there is no rest,

      Because gone up above mine head

      I have been made to roar.

      O Lord, all that I do desire
      is still before thine eye;
      And of my heart the secret groans
      not hidden are from thee.

      My heart doth pant incessantly,
      my strength doth quite decay;
      As for mine eyes, their wonted light
      is from me gone away.

      My lovers and my friends do stand
      at distance from my sore;
      And those do stand aloof that were
      kinsmen and kind before.

      Yea, they that seek my life lay snares:
      who seek to do me wrong
      Speak things mischievous, and deceits
      imagine all day long.

      But, as one deaf, that heareth not,
      I suffered all to pass;
      I as a dumb man did become,
      whose mouth not opened was:

      As one that hears not, in whose mouth
      are no reproofs at all.
      For, LORD, I hope in thee; my God,
      thou'lt hear me when I call.

      For I said, Hear me, lest they should
      rejoice o'er me with pride;
      And o'er me magnify themselves,
      when as my foot doth slide.

      For I am near to halt, my grief
      is still before mine eye:
      For I'll declare my sin, and grieve
      for mine iniquity.

      But yet mine en'mies lively are,
      and strong are they beside;
      And they that hate me wrongfully
      are greatly multiplied.

      And they for good that render ill,
      as en'mies me withstood;
      Yea, ev'n for this, because that I
      do follow what is good.

      Forsake me not, O LORD; my God,
      far from me never be.
      O Lord, thou my salvation art,
      haste to give help to me.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm appears to have been penned by David, under some remarkable
        distress, attended with a deep sense of sin as the procuring cause of
        it. Here are, (1.) David's sorrowful complaints of God's sore
        displeasure, and of the weight of his own sins, ver. 1-5; of the
        sickness of his body, and distress of his mind, ver. 6-10; of the
        unkindness of his friends, ver. 11; and of the unprovoked injuries he
        received from his enemies, who were spiteful, cruel, subtile, unjust,
        ungrateful, impious, devilish, numerous and powerful, ver. 12, 20.
        (2.) His remarkable patience and resignation under his troubles, ver.
        13-15. (3.) His fervent supplications to God for the mitigation of his
        troubles, ver. 1; and for comfort and support under, and speedy
        deliverance from them, ver. 16, 21-22; attended with candid and
        ingenuous acknowledgment of the sinful causes thereof, ver. 3-5,
        18.<br/><br/><br/>In all my troubles, let me search out, and by faith
        confess and mourn over the sinful causes of them. Let me take every
        distress as out of God's hand; and call on him in the time thereof,
        that he may deliver me.

      I said, I will look to my ways,
      lest with my tongue I sin:
      In sight of wicked men my mouth
      with bridle I'll keep in.

      With silence I as dumb became,
      I did myself restrain
      From speaking good; but then the more
      increasèd was my pain.

      My heart within me waxèd hot;
      and, while I musing was,
      The fire did burn; and from my tongue
      these words I did let pass:

      Mine end, and measure of my days,
      O LORD, unto me show
      What is the same; that I thereby
      my frailty well may know.

      Lo, thou my days an handbreadth mad'st;
      mine age is in thine eye
      As nothing: sure each man at best
      is wholly vanity.

      Sure each man walks in a vain show;
      they vex themselves in vain:
      He heaps up wealth, and doth not know
      to whom it shall pertain.

      And now, O Lord, what wait I for?
      my hope is fixed on thee.
      Free me from all my trespasses,
      the fool's scorn make not me.

      Dumb was I, op'ning not my mouth,
      because this work was thine.
      Thy stroke take from me; by the blow
      of thine hand I do pine.

      When with rebukes thou dost correct
      man for iniquity,
      Thou wastes his beauty like a moth:
      sure each man's vanity.

      Attend my cry, LORD, at my tears
      and pray'rs not silent be:
      I sojourn as my fathers all,
      and stranger am with thee.

      O spare thou me, that I my strength
      recover may again,
      Before from hence I do depart,
      and here no more remain.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Here we have, (1.) Violent struggling in the psalmist's own breast
        between grace and corruption; between passion and patience, ver. 1-3,
        11. (2.) Serious views of human frailty, shortness of life, and self-
        emptiness, ver. 4-6. (3.) Strong cries to God, for pardon of sin,
        preservation from reproach, and for removal of trouble; for hearing
        and answering of prayer, and for lengthening out of life, till further
        preparation for death should be attained, ver.
        7-13.<br/><br/><br>While I sing, let my soul blush deep, for the
        untenderness and want of circumspection, in my life, and for my want
        of resignation to God's disposing will. Let me be suitably affected
        with the shortness, vanity, and uncertainty of my temporal life. Let
        me be always exercised in earnest prayer to, and believing dependence
        on God, as my companion and friend.

      I waited for the LORD my God,
      and patiently did bear;
      At length to me he did incline
      my voice and cry to hear.

      He took me from a fearful pit,
      and from the miry clay,
      And on a rock he set my feet,
      establishing my way.

      He put a new song in my mouth,
      our God to magnify:
      Many shall see it, and shall fear,
      and on the LORD rely.

      O blessèd is the man whose trust
      upon the LORD relies;
      Respecting not the proud, nor such
      as turn aside to lies.

      O LORD my God, full many are
      the wonders thou hast done;
      Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward far
      above all thoughts are gone:

      In order none can reckon them
      to thee: if them declare,
      And speak of them I would, they more
      than can be numbered are.

      No sacrifice nor offering
      didst thou at all desire;
      Mine ears thou bored: sin-off'ring thou
      and burnt didst not require:

      Then to the Lord these were my words,
      I come, behold and see;
      Within the volume of the book
      it written is of me:

      To do thy will I take delight,
      O thou my God that art;
      Yea, that most holy law of thine
      I have within my heart.

      Within the congregation great
      I righteousness did preach:
      Lo, thou dost know, O LORD, that I
      refrainèd not my speech.

      I never did within my heart
      conceal thy righteousness;
      I thy salvation have declared,
      and shown thy faithfulness:

      Thy kindness, which most loving is,
      concealèd have not I,
      Nor from the congregation great
      have hid thy verity.

      Thy tender mercies, LORD, from me
      O do thou not restrain;
      Thy loving-kindness, and thy truth,
      let them me still maintain.

      For ills past reck'ning compass me,
      and mine iniquities
      Such hold upon me taken have,
      I cannot lift mine eyes:

      They more than hairs are on mine head,
      thence is my heart dismayed.
      Be pleasèd, LORD, to rescue me;
      LORD, hasten to mine aid.

      Shamed and confounded be they all
      that seek my soul to kill;
      Yea, let them backward driven be,
      and shamed, that wish me ill.

      For a reward of this their shame
      confounded let them be,
      That in this manner scoffing say,
      Aha, aha! to me.

      In thee let all be glad, and joy,
      who seeking thee abide;
      Who thy salvation love, say still,
      The LORD be magnified.

      I'm poor and needy, yet the Lord
      of me a care doth take:
      Thou art my help and säviour,
      my God, no tarrying make.

        Here we have, (1.) David's hearty acknowledgments of God's kindness,
        in bringing him out of long and sore afflictions, ver. 1-5. (2.) His
        preferring of holy obedience to God, and faithful publication of his
        truths and praises, to all ceremonial oblations, ver. 6-11. (3.) His
        improvement of his former deliverance, as an encouragement to
        supplicate further mercy and protection; an encouragement to confess
        sin, and implore the pardon thereof; an encouragement to rejoice in,
        and praise God for his excellencies and favours; to trust him under
        affliction, and to comfort himself in him, as his help and Saviour,
        amidst poverty, sinfulness, and trouble, ver. 12-17.<br/><br/><br/>But
        let me here chiefly think, (1.) Of Jesus the great Shepherd of the
        sheep, who was brought again from his agonies and death, by the blood
        of the everlasting covenant, and set down at the right hand of the
        Majesty on high, that he might receive gifts for men, and that our
        faith and hope might be in God, ver. 1-5. (2.) Let me think of the new
        covenant, made between him and his eternal Father, for the redemption
        of sinful men; and of his complete fulfilment of the divine law as the
        condition thereof, ver. 6-10. (3.) Let me think how our iniquities
        were charged to his account, and punished on him, as our Surety, ver.
        11-13. (4.) Let me think how the unrelenting vengeance of Almighty
        God, overtook his Jewish betrayers and murderers; and hath, or will
        overtake his Heathenish, Antichristian, or other implacable enemies;
        and of the joy and consolation, which flow from and through him to his
        chosen friends, ver. 14-17.

      Blessèd is he that wisely doth
      the poor man's case consider;
      For when the time of trouble is,
      the LORD will him deliver.

      GOD will him keep, yea, save alive;
      on earth he blessed shall live;
      And to his enemies' desire
      thou wilt him not up give.

      GOD will give strength when he on bed
      of languishing doth mourn;
      And in his sickness sore, O LORD,
      thou all his bed wilt turn.

      I said, O LORD, do thou extend
      thy mercy unto me;
      O do thou heal my soul; for why?
      I have offended thee.

      Those that to me are enemies,
      of me do evil say,
      When shall he die, that so his name
      may perish quite away?

      To see me if he comes, he speaks
      vain words: but then his heart
      Heaps mischief to it, which he tells,
      when forth he doth depart.

      My haters jointly whispering,
      'gainst me my hurt devise.
      Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him;
      he lieth, and shall not rise.

      Yea, ev'n mine own familiar friend,
      on whom I did rely,
      Who ate my bread, ev'n he his heel
      against me lifted high.

      But, LORD, be merciful to me,
      and up again me raise,
      That I may justly them requite
      according to their ways.

      By this I know that certainly
      I favoured am by thee;
      Because my hateful enemy
      triumphs not over me.

      But as for me, thou me uphold'st
      in mine integrity;
      And me before thy countenance
      thou sett'st continually.

      The LORD, the God of Israel,
      be blessed for ever then,
      From age to age eternally.
      Amen, yea, and amen.

        Jesus, who had not where to lay his head; Jesus whom his own disciple

        entered into the kingdom of God!

      Like as the hart for water-brooks
      in thirst doth pant and bray;
      So pants my longing soul, O God,
      that come to thee I may.

      My soul for God, the living God,
      doth thirst: when shall I near
      Unto thy countenance approach,
      and in God's sight appear?

      My tears have unto me been meat,
      both in the night and day,
      While unto me continually,
      Where is thy God? they say.

      My soul is pourèd out in me,
      when this I think upon;
      Because that with the multitude
      I heretofore had gone:

      With them into God's house I went,
      with voice of joy and praise;
      Yea, with the multitude that kept
      the solemn holy days.

      O why art thou cast down, my soul?
      why in me so dismayed?
      Trust God, for I shall praise him yet,
      his count'nance is mine aid.

      My God, my soul's cast down in me;
      thee therefore mind I will
      From Jordan's land, the Hermonites,
      and ev'n from Mizar hill.

      At the noise of thy water-spouts
      deep unto deep doth call;
      Thy breaking waves pass over me,
      yea, and thy billows all.

      His loving-kindness yet the LORD
      command will in the day,
      His song's with me by night; to God,
      by whom I live, I'll pray:

      And I will say to God my rock,
      Why me forgett'st thou so?
      Why, for my foes' opprëssion,
      thus mourning do I go?

      'Tis as a sword within my bones,
      when my foes me upbraid;
      Ev'n when by them, Where is thy God?
      'tis daily to me said.

      O why art thou cast down, my soul?
      why, thus with grief oppressed,
      Art thou disquieted in me?
      in God still hope and rest:

      The health is of my countenance,
      yea, mine own God is he.

        Perhaps this psalm was composed by David, when the unnatural rebellion
        of Absalom had forced him from the sanctuary of God, and to take up
        his lodging eastward of Jordan, 2 Sam. 15:13-19. We have in it, (1.)
        Ardent longings after nearness to, and familiar intimacy with God, in
        his public ordinances and sanctuary, ver. 1-2. (2.) Mournful
        lamentations and bitter groanings on account of God's withdrawing his
        comfortable smiles; of the want of the once-enjoyed ordinances of God,
        and fellowship with his saints; of the depressing impressions of God's
        wrath; and of his enemies' insolent upbraiding of him on account of
        the departure and distance of his God, ver. 3-4, 6-7, 9-10. (3.)
        Believing remembrance of God's former favours, ver. 6; and self-
        encouraging hopes of future ones, ver. 5, 8, 11.<br/><br/><br/>Have I
        experimentally understood all these things? My soul, let me charge
        thee to beware of dissimulation with God, and of compassing him about
        with lies, under pretence of praising him. Dare not to sing these
        lines without inward, without ardent longings for the Lord; without
        earnest claiming of him as thy own God, upon the foundation of his
        new-covenant grant of himself to me in the gospel; without assured
        hopes of his future, his everlasting kindness to me-ward.

      O God, we with our ears have heard,
      our fathers have us told,
      What works thou in their days hadst done,
      ev'n in the days of old.

      Thy hand did drive the heathen out,
      and plant them in their place;
      Thou didst afflict the nätions,
      but them thou didst increase.

      For neither got their sword the land,
      nor did their arm them save;
      But thy right hand, arm, countenance;
      for thou them favour gave.

      Thou art my King: for Jacob, Lord,
      deliv'rances command.
      Through thee we shall push down our foes,
      that do against us stand:

      We, through thy name, shall tread down those
      that ris'n against us have.
      For in my bow I shall not trust,
      nor shall my sword me save.

      But from our foes thou hast us saved,
      our haters put to shame.
      In God we all the day do boast,
      and ever praise thy name.

      But now we are cast off by thee,
      and us thou putt'st to shame;
      And when our armies do go forth,
      thou goest not with the same.

      Thou mak'st us from the enemy,
      faint-hearted, to turn back;
      And they who hate us for themselves
      our spoils away do take.

      Like sheep for meat thou gavest us;
      'mong heathen cast we be.
      Thou didst for nought thy people sell;
      their price enriched not thee.

      Thou mak'st us a reproach to be
      unto our neighbours near;
      Derision and a scorn to them
      that round about us are.

      A by-word also thou dost us
      among the heathen make;
      The people, in contempt and spite,
      at us their heads do shake.

      Before me my confüsion
      continually abides;
      And of my bashful countenance
      the shame me ever hides:

      For voice of him that doth reproach,
      and speaketh blasphemy;
      By reason of th' avenging foe,
      and cruel enemy.

      All this is come on us, yet we
      have not forgotten thee;
      Nor falsely in thy covenant
      behaved ourselves have we.

      Back from thy way our heart not turned;
      our steps no straying made;
      Though us thou brak'st in dragons' place,
      and cover'dst with death's shade.

      If we God's name forgot, or stretched
      to a strange god our hands,
      Shall not God search this out? for he
      heart's secrets understands.

      Yea, for thy sake we're killed all day,
      counted as slaughter-sheep.
      Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off;
      awake, why dost thou sleep?

      O wherefore hidest thou thy face?
      forgett'st our cause distressed,
      And our oppression? For our soul
      is to the dust down pressed:

      Our belly also on the earth

        Sorrowful complaints of divine desertion; and of the prevalent power,
        cruelty, and derisive contempt of enemies, ver. 9-16. (3.) Solemn
        protestation of continued integrity, and of constant adherence to the
        Lord's way, amidst these manifold calamities, ver. 17-22. (4.) Strong

      My heart brings forth a goodly thing;
      my words that I indite
      Concern the King: my tongue's a pen
      of one that swift doth write.

      Thou fairer art than sons of men:
      into thy lips is store
      Of grace infused; God therefore thee
      hath blessed for evermore.

      O thou that art the mighty One,
      thy sword gird on thy thigh;
      Ev'n with thy glory excellent,
      and with thy majesty.

      For meekness, truth, and righteousness,
      in state ride prosp'rously;
      And thy right hand shall thee instruct
      in things that fearful be.

      Thine arrows sharply pierce the heart
      of th' en'mies of the King;
      And under thy subjëction
      the people down do bring.

      For ever and for ever is,
      O God, thy throne of might;
      The sceptre of thy kingdom is
      a sceptre that is right.

      Thou lovest right, and hatest ill;
      for God, thy God, most high,
      Above thy fellows hath with th' oil
      of joy anointed thee.

      Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia,
      a smell thy garments had,
      Out of the iv'ry palaces,
      whereby they made thee glad.

      Among thy women hon'rable
      kings' daughters were at hand:
      Upon thy right hand did the queen
      in gold of Ophir stand.

      O daughter, hearken and regard,
      and do thine ear incline;
      Likewise forget thy father's house,
      and people that are thine.

      Then of the King desired shall be
      thy beauty veh'mently:
      Because he is thy Lord, do thou
      him worship rev'rently.

      The daughter there of Tyre shall be
      with gifts and off'rings great:
      Those of the people that are rich
      thy favour shall entreat.

      Behold, the daughter of the King
      all glorious is within;
      And with embroideries of gold
      her garments wrought have been.

      She shall be brought unto the King
      in robes with needle wrought;
      Her fellow-virgins following
      shall unto thee be brought.

      They shall be brought with gladness great,
      and mirth on ev'ry side,
      Into the palace of the King,
      and there they shall abide.

      Instead of those thy fathers dear,
      thy children thou may'st take,
      And in all places of the earth
      them noble princes make.

      Thy name remembered I will make
      through ages all to be:
      The people therefore evermore
      shall praises give to thee.

      My heart inditing is
      good matter in a song:
      I speak the things that I have made,
      which to the King belong:

      My tongue shall be as quick,
      his honour to indite,
      As is the pen of any scribe
      that useth fast to write.

      Thou 'rt fairest of all men;
      grace in thy lips doth flow:
      And therefore blessings evermore
      on thee doth God bestow.

      Thy sword gird on thy thigh,
      thou that art most of might:
      Appear in dreadful majesty,
      and in thy glory bright.

      For meekness, truth, and right,
      ride prosp'rously in state;
      And thy right hand shall teach to thee
      things terrible and great.

      Thy shafts shall pierce their hearts
      that foes are to the King;
      Whereby into subjëction
      the people thou shalt bring.

      Thy royal seat, O Lord,
      for ever shall remain:
      The sceptre of thy kingdom doth
      all righteousness maintain.

      Thou lov'st right, and hat'st ill;

      Of myrrh and spices sweet
      a smell thy garments had,
      Out of the iv'ry palaces,
      whereby they made thee glad.

      And in thy glorious train
      kings' daughters waiting stand;
      And thy fair queen, in Ophir gold,
      doth stand at thy right hand.

      O daughter, take good heed,
      incline, and give good ear;
      Thou must forget thy kindred all,
      and father's house most dear.

      Thy beauty to the King
      shall then delightful be:
      And do thou humbly worship him,
      because thy Lord is he.

      The daughter then of Tyre
      there with a gift shall be,
      And all the wealthy of the land
      shall make their suit to thee.

      The daughter of the King
      all glorious is within;
      And with embroideries of gold
      her garments wrought have been.

      She cometh to the King
      in robes with needle wrought;
      The virgins that do follow her
      shall unto thee be brought.

      They shall be brought with joy,
      and mirth on ev'ry side,
      Into the palace of the King,
      and there they shall abide.

      And in thy fathers' stead,
      thy children thou may'st take,
      And in all places of the earth

        In this song of loves, are celebrated, (1.) The glories of Jesus our
        Redeemer, particularly the transcendant comeliness and blessedness of
        his person, God-man; his almighty power in conquering his people, and
        destroying his enemies; the eternity, firmness, and equity of his
        government: his royal unction with the Holy Ghost above measure; his
        fitness for his work, and the splendour of his court, ver. 1-9. (2.)
        The glories of the redeemed; their listening to Jesus' proposals of
        marriage union with himself; their renunciation of all others for his
        sake; their reverential submission to, and worship of him, ver. 10-11;
        their glorious ornaments of righteousness and grace; and their
        glorious entrance into the new covenant, and the eternal state, ver.
        12-15; their glorious succession and work, for perpetuating the fame
        of the Redeemer, ver. 16-17.<br/><br/><br/>In singing this song of the
        Lamb, let me with open face behold his glory, and be changed into the
        same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord. Let my
        admiration of his excellency swell to the brim, and my love burn with
        a most vehement flame; and let my hopes of being for ever with him, be
        strong and lively. Let my heart be all wonder at his excellency,
        fulness, and grace - all subjection to his government and laws; and
        let my lips be filled with his praise and honour all the day.

      God is our refuge and our strength,
      in straits a present aid;
      Therefore, although the earth remove,
      we will not be afraid:

      Though hills amidst the seas be cast;
      Though waters roaring make,
      And troubled be; yea, though the hills
      by swelling seas do shake.

      A river is, whose streams do glad
      the city of our God;
      The holy place, wherein the Lord
      most high hath his abode.

      God in the midst of her doth dwell;
      nothing shall her remove:
      The Lord to her an helper will,
      and that right early, prove.

      The heathen raged tumultuously,
      the kingdoms movèd were:
      The Lord God utterèd his voice,
      the earth did melt for fear.

      The LORD of hosts upon our side
      doth constantly remain:
      The God of Jacob's our refuge,
      us safely to maintain.

      Come, and behold what wondrous works
      have by the LORD been wrought;
      Come, see what desolätions
      he on the earth hath brought.

      Unto the ends of all the earth
      wars into peace he turns:
      The bow he breaks, the spear he cuts,
      in fire the chariot burns.

      Be still, and know that I am God;
      among the heathen I
      Will be exalted; I on earth
      will be exalted high.

      Our God, who is the LORD of hosts,
      is still upon our side;
      The God of Jacob our refuge
      for ever will abide.

        distress which can be supposed, ver. 1-6. (2.) A thankful rehearsal of
        the great things which God had wrought for the deliverance of his
        people, and the destruction of their enemies, ver. 6-9. (3.) God's
        heart-composing promise of promoting his own glory in every
        providence; and faith's expectation of protection and safety, ver

        providing portions for themselves; and in ascending to heaven, to
        receive gifts, and prepare places for men, ver. 3-5; as also the high

      Great is the LORD, and greatly he

      Mount Zion stands most beautiful,
      the joy of all the land;
      The city of the mighty King
      on her north side doth stand.

      The Lord within her palaces
      is for a refuge known.
      For, lo, the kings that gathered were
      together, by have gone.

      But when they did behold the same,
      they, wond'ring, would not stay;
      But, being troubled at the sight,

      Great terror there took hold on them;

        of Hezekiah, 2 Kings 19. We have here, (1.) Jerusalem, the capital
        city of Israel, and type of the gospel church and heavenly state,
        celebrated for her beauty and relation to God, as the residence of his
        temple and ordinances, ver. 1-2. (2.) Jehovah, the God of Israel,
        celebrated for his kind and powerful protection of Jerusalem, and for
        making her enemies flee off with much precipitation and terror, ver.
        3-7. (3.) The people of God, particularly in Jerusalem, meditating
        upon, and celebrating the gracious and mighty things, which God had,
        or would do for them, and for his discoveries of himself to them; and
        promising themselves sure and lasting happiness in his relation to,

      unto the beasts that die.

      Thus brutish folly plainly is
      their wisdom and their way;
      Yet their posterity approve
      what they do fondly say.

      Like sheep they in the grave are laid,
      and death shall them devour;
      And in the morning upright men
      shall over them have power:

      Their beauty from their dwelling shall
      consume within the grave.
      But from hell's hand God will me free,
      for he shall me receive.

      Be thou not then afraid when one

      when death his days doth end;
      Nor shall his glory after him
      into the grave descend.

      Although he his own soul did bless
      whilst he on earth did live;
      (And when thou to thyself dost well,
      men will thee praises give;)

        all ranks of mankind to a serious consideration of this matter, as a
        point of great importance and universal concern, ver. 1-4. (2.) His
        irrefragable proofs of the vanity of earthly enjoyments - viz., that
        they cannot save from death either a man's self or his friend; and
        that they cannot make men wise or happy in this world, and far less
        render them happy in the future state, ver. 6-14. (3.) His attempt to
        comfort himself and other saints, under the sense of their daily
        infirmities, and of the chastisements received on account of their
        sins; and against the slavish fears of death, and temptations arising
        from the prosperity of the wicked, ver. 5, 15-18.<br/><br/><br> While
        I sing, let me bewail my sinful minding of, and idolatrous attachment

        affections on things above, where Christ is at the right hand of God.

      And beauty the perfection is,
      God shinèd gloriously.

      Our God shall surely come;
      keep silence shall not he:
      Before him fire shall waste, great storms
      shall round about him be.

      Unto the heavens clear
      he from above shall call,
      And to the earth likewise, that he
      may judge his people all.

      Together let my saints
      unto me gathered be,
      Those that by sacrifice have made
      a covenant with me.

      And then the heavens shall
      his righteousness declare:
      Because the Lord himself is he
      by whom men judgèd are.

      My people Isr'el hear,
      speak will I from on high,
      Against thee I will testify;
      God, ev'n thy God, am I.

      I for thy sacrifice
      no blame will on thee lay,
      Nor for burnt-off'rings, which to me
      thou offer'dst ev'ry day.

      I'll take no calf nor goats
      from house or fold of thine:
      For beasts of forest, cattle all
      on thousand hills, are mine.

      The fowls on mountains high
      are all to me well known;
      Wild beasts which in the fields do lie,
      ev'n they are all mine own.

      Then, if I hungry were,
      I would not tell it thee;
      Because the world, and fulness all
      thereof, belongs to me.

      Will I eat flesh of bulls?
      or goats' blood drink will I?
      Thanks offer thou to God, and pay
      thy vows to the Most High.

      And call upon me when
      in trouble thou shalt be;
      I will deliver thee, and thou
      my name shalt glorify.

      But to the wicked man
      God saith, My laws and truth
      Should'st thou declare? how dar'st thou take
      my cov'nant in thy mouth?

      Sith thou instruction hat'st,
      which should thy ways direct;
      And sith my words behind thy back
      thou cast'st, and dost reject.

      When thou a thief didst see,
      with him thou didst consent;
      And with the vile adulterers
      partaker on thou went.

      Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill,
      thy tongue deceit doth frame;
      Thou sitt'st, and 'gainst thy brother speak'st,
      thy mother's son dost shame.

      Because I silence kept,
      while thou these things hast wrought;
      That I was altogether like
      thyself, hath been thy thought;

      Yet I will thee reprove,
      and set before thine eyes,
      In order rankèd, thy misdeeds
      and thine iniquities.

      Now, ye that God forget,
      this carefully consider;
      Lest I in pieces tear you all,
      and none can you deliver.

      Whoso doth offer praise
      me glorifies; and I
      Will show him God's salvätion,
      that orders right his way.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm is a mirror calculated to exhibit the emptiness of all
        worldly enjoyments. Observe, (1.) David's earnest attempt to awaken
        all ranks of mankind to a serious consideration of this matter, as a
        point of great importance and universal concern, ver. 1-4. (2.) His
        irrefragable proofs of the vanity of earthly enjoyments - viz., that
        they cannot save from death either a man's self or his friend; and
        that they cannot make men wise or happy in this world, and far less
        render them happy in the future state, ver. 6-14. (3.) His attempt to
        comfort himself and other saints, under the sense of their daily
        infirmities, and of the chastisements received on account of their
        sins; and against the slavish fears of death, and temptations arising
        from the prosperity of the wicked, ver. 5, 15-18.<br/><br/><br> While
        I sing, let me bewail my sinful minding of, and idolatrous attachment
        to earthly things. Let me be henceforth as a weaned child, setting my
        affections on things above, where Christ is at the right hand of God.
        Let no uncertain riches or honours, but the living God, be the object
        of all my trust and joy.

      The mighty God, the LORD, hath spoke,
      and called the earth upon,
      Ev'n from the rising of the sun
      unto his going down.

      From out of Zion, his own hill,
      where the perfection high
      Of beauty is, from thence the Lord
      hath shinèd gloriously.

      Our God shall come, and shall no more
      be silent, but speak out:
      Before him fire shall waste, great storms
      shall compass him about.

      He to the heavens from above,
      and to the earth below,
      Shall call, that he his judgments may
      before his people show.

      Let all my saints together be
      unto me gatherèd;
      Those that by sacrifice with me
      a covenant have made.

      And then the heavens shall declare
      his righteousness abroad:
      Because the Lord himself doth come;
      none else is judge but God.

      Hear, O my people, and I'll speak;
      O Israèl by name,
      Against thee I will testify;
      God, ev'n thy God, I am.

      I for thy sacrifices few
      reprove thee never will,
      Nor for burnt-off'rings to have been
      before me offered still.

      I'll take no bullock nor he-goats
      from house nor folds of thine:
      For beasts of forest, cattle all
      on thousand hills, are mine.

      The fowls are all to me well known
      that mountains high do yield;
      And I do challenge as mine own
      the wild beasts of the field.

      If I were hungry, I would not
      to thee for need complain;
      For earth, and all its fulness, doth
      to me of right pertain.

      That I to eat the flesh of bulls
      take pleasure dost thou think?
      Or that I need, to quench my thirst,
      the blood of goats to drink?

      Nay, rather unto me, thy God,
      thanksgiving offer thou:
      To the Most High perform thy word,
      and fully pay thy vow:

      And in the day of trouble great
      see that thou call on me;
      I will deliver thee, and thou
      my name shalt glorify.

      But God unto the wicked saith,
      Why should'st thou mention make
      Of my commands? how dar'st thou in
      thy mouth my cov'nant take?

      Sith it is so that thou dost hate
      all good instrüction;
      And sith thou cast'st behind thy back,
      and slight'st my words each one.

      When thou a thief didst see, then straight
      thou join'dst with him in sin,
      And with the vile adulterers
      thou hast partaker been.

      Thy mouth to evil thou dost give,
      thy tongue deceit doth frame.
      Thou sitt'st, and 'gainst thy brother speak'st,
      thy mother's son to shame.

      These things thou wickedly hast done,
      and I have silent been:
      Thou thought'st that I was like thyself,
      and did approve thy sin:

      But I will sharply thee reprove,
      and I will order right
      Thy sins and thy transgrëssions
      in presence of thy sight.

      Consider this, and be afraid,
      ye that forget the Lord,
      Lest I in pieces tear you all,
      when none can help afford.

      Who off'reth praise me glorifies:
      I will show God's salvation
      To him that ordereth aright
      his life and conversation.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm may be considered as a rebuke to the carnal Jews who rested
        in, and boasted of their external ceremonies in worship, to the
        neglect of the weightier matters of the law - mercy, judgment, and
        faith; or as a prediction of the coming of Christ, to abolish the
        ceremonial worship, eject the Jews from his church, and establish a
        more pure and spiritual form of worship under the gospel: or, in fine,
        as a representation of the last judgment; in which Christ shall come,
        to render to every man according to his deeds. Observe, (1.) The awful
        appearance of God our Redeemer, in the flesh, in power, or in the
        clouds; with the gathering of the people to him, ver. 1-6. (2.) An
        engaging admonition to improve God's new-covenant grant of himself to
        be our God, as an excitement to exchange legal ceremonies into prayer,
        thanksgiving and holy obedience; or, at least, to give a remarkable
        preference to the latter, ver. 7-15. (3.) A terrible charge of
        hypocrisy, slander, contempt of God's word, and of atheistical
        imaginations concerning God, laid against the wicked, with a fearful
        sentence of condemnation founded thereon, ver. 16-22. (4.) An alarming
        warning of danger to the forgetters of God, and an encouraging promise
        to such as study to glorify him by a holy conversation, ver.
        22-23.<br/><br/><br/>Sing this, my soul, with solemn awe, assisted
        before the great Searcher of hearts, and as by faith beholding Jesus
        in my nature, sitting on his great white throne, gathering the nations
        to his bar, opening the books, and judging mankind out of the things
        found written therein.

      After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
      have mercy upon me:
      For thy compassions great, blot out
      all mine iniquity.

      Me cleanse from sin, and throughly wash
      from mine iniquity:
      For my transgressions I confess;
      my sin I ever see.

      'Gainst thee, thee only, have I sinned,
      in thy sight done this ill;
      That when thou speak'st thou may'st be just,
      and clear in judging still.

      Behold, I in iniquity
      was formed the womb within;
      My mother also me conceived
      in guiltiness and sin.

      Behold, thou in the inward parts
      with truth delighted art;
      And wisdom thou shalt make me know
      within the hidden part.

      Do thou with hyssop sprinkle me,
      I shall be cleansèd so;
      Yea, wash thou me, and then I shall
      be whiter than the snow.

      Of gladness and of joyfulness
      make me to hear the voice;
      That so these very bones which thou
      hast broken may rejoice.

      All mine iniquities blot out,
      thy face hide from my sin.
      Create a clean heart, Lord, renew
      a right spirit me within.

      Cast me not from thy sight, nor take
      thy Holy Spirit away.
      Restore me thy salvation's joy;
      with thy free Spirit me stay.

      Then will I teach thy ways unto
      those that transgressors be;
      And those that sinners are shall then
      be turnèd unto thee.

      O God, of my salvation God,
      me from blood-guiltiness
      Set free; then shall my tongue aloud
      sing of thy righteousness.

      My closèd lips, O Lord, by thee
      let them be openèd;
      Then shall thy praises by my mouth
      abroad be publishèd.

      For thou desir'st not sacrifice,
      else would I give it thee;
      Nor wilt thou with burnt-offering
      at all delighted be.

      A broken spirit is to God
      a pleasing sacrifice:
      A broken and a contrite heart,
      Lord, thou wilt not despise.

      Show kindness, and do good, O Lord,
      to Zion, thine own hill:
      The walls of thy Jerusalem
      build up of thy good will.

      Then righteous off'rings shall thee please,
      and off'rings burnt, which they
      With whole burnt-off'rings, and with calves,
      shall on thine altar lay.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was penned by David, when reproved by Nathan for his
        adultery with Bathsheba, and for his murder of Uriah, 2 Sam. 12. We
        have in it, (1.) David's candid and truly sorrowful acknowledgments of
        his sin, particularly his adultery and murder, as highly dishonouring
        to God; and of his original sin, as the source thereof, ver. 1-5, 17.
        (2.) His earnest supplications for pardon of his offences, and for
        heart-purifying, and renewing grace; for renewed influences of the
        Holy Ghost; for peace of conscience, and comfortable fellowship with
        God, for himself, ver. 1-2, 6-15; and for reformation of, and
        prosperity to the church, which had been hurt by his sin, ver. 18-19.
        (3.) His sincere purposes of heart, to improve God's favour to
        himself, in promoting the instruction of others, and in giving them an
        honourable pattern of an exact celebration of God's public worship,
        ver. 13-16, 19.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing this penitential psalm, let
        my heart be filled with clear but evangelic views of my aggravated, my
        unnumbered transgressions; and with deep sorrow and remorse for them.
        Let me pour forth supplications, strong cries and tears to him who is
        able to forgive all mine iniquities, and to deliver me from every
        corruption. Let me wash myself in Jesus' blood, as the fountain opened
        to men for sin and for uncleanness.

      Thy tongue mischievous calumnies

        This psalm relates to Doeg the Edomite, who informed Saul how
        Ahimelech the high priest had entertained David and his servants; and
        who, in consequence thereof, had murdered Ahimelech, and above
        fourscore other priests, 1 Sam. 22. Here, (1.) David charges Doeg
        that, notwithstanding the manifested and everlasting goodness of God,
        he gloried in his malice, craft, cruelty, and other wickedness, ver.
        1-5. (2.) By the spirit of prophecy he condemns him for his
        wickedness, to be plucked from his dwelling, and rooted out of the
        land of the living, to the great joy of the fearers of God, ver. 6-7.
        (3.) He comforts himself in the everlasting mercy of God, and with the
        assured hopes that he should yet praise him for his kindness, ver,
        8-9.<br/><br/><br/>Learn, O my soul, to detest all deceit and cruelty.
        Learn to imitate the goodness of God, which endureth continually; and
        while friends are cut off, or foes prevail, let me live by faith on a
        gracious God, as my all and in all.

      Attend and hear me; in my plaint

      Because of th' en'my's voice, and for
      lewd men's oppression great:
      On me they cast iniquity,
      and they in wrath me hate.

      Sore pained within me is my heart:

      On me comes trembling, fear and dread
      o'erwhelmèd me withal.

      O that I, like a dove, had wings,

      by breaking he profaned.

      More smooth than butter were his words,
      while in his heart was war;
      His speeches were more soft than oil,
      and yet drawn swords they are.

      Cast thou thy burden on the LORD,
      and he shall thee sustain;
      Yea, he shall cause the righteous man
      unmovèd to remain.

      But thou, O Lord my God, those men
      in justice shalt o'erthrow,
      And in destruction's dungeon dark
      at last shalt lay them low:

      The bloody and deceitful men
      shall not live half their days:
      But upon thee with confidence
      I will depend always.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was probably penned by David when he fled from Jerusalem
        for fear of Absalom his son, 2 Sam. 15-16. Observe, (1.) David's
        earnest prayers for help and favour from God, amidst his great
        oppression, griefs, and fears, ver. 1-8. (2.) His request for the just
        manifestation of God's vengeance, in the dispersion and destruction of
        his enemies, who, in Jerusalem, particularly Ahithophel, had behaved
        in so base and treacherous a manner, ver. 9-15. (3.) Resolved on
        frequent and fervent prayer, he encourages himself and friends to
        trust in God for support and deliverance, and for the speedy
        destruction of their enemies, however deceitful and bloody, ver.
        16-23.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, behold, my soul, as in a glass, how
        Jesus our Redeemer, was hated, was betrayed, and murdered by his
        brethren of Judah, at Jerusalem; and how the fearful vengeance of the
        Almighty overtook them, on that account. And if I am oppressed,
        defamed, or persecuted, that I know not whither to flee; if in cities,
        or by particular friends, wickedness and malice discover themselves,
        let me study resignation to the disposals of Providence, and call upon
        God in the assured hopes that he will answer in due time. Let me cast
        all my wants and burdens on him, who is my God, that doth me save.

      Show mercy, Lord, to me, for man

      They daily would me swallow up
      that hate me spitefully;

      against me, O Most High.

      When I'm afraid I'll trust in thee:

      I will not fear what flesh can do,
      my trust is in the Lord.

      Each day they wrest my words; their thoughts
      'gainst me are all for ill.
      They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps,
      waiting my soul to kill.

      But shall they by iniquity
      escape thy judgments so?
      O God, with indignation down
      do thou the people throw.

      My wand'rings all what they have been

      Into thy bottle put my tears:
      are they not in thy book?

      My foes shall, when I cry, turn back;
      I know 't, God is for me.
      In God his word I'll praise; his word
      in GOD shall praisèd be.

      In God I trust; I will not fear
      what man can do to me.
      Thy vows upon me are, O God:
      I'll render praise to thee.

      Wilt thou not, who from death me saved,
      my feet from falls keep free,
      To walk before God in the light
      of those that living be?

        This psalm was penned by David, when the Philistines apprehended him
        in Gath, 1 Sam. 21:10-15. It contains, (1.) His earnest supplications
        to God for merciful protection, and deliverance from his enemies, who
        were barbarous, powerful, crafty, malicious, and restless, ver. 1-2,
        5-7. (2.) His assured confidence in God, as his own God, who had
        spoken good concerning him, and took particular notice of his
        grievances, ver. 3-4, 8, 11. (3.) Firm hopes that his prayers should
        issue in the defeat of his enemies, and that his faith would set him
        above the slavish fears of men, ver. 9-11; and that, while he paid his
        vows to God, he should have further occasion to praise the Lord, for
        what he had done, and would do for him, ver. 12-13. Thus let me, in
        all my straits, have recourse to God. While his promises remain
        infallible, let me rejoice therein, and, without anxiety, cheerfully
        expect their fulfillment.

        cruelty, malice, and calumnious deceit of his inveterate enemies, ver.
        3-4, 6. (3.) His believing triumph in God; in which he prepares
        himself for praising God, excites himself to it, delights himself in
        it, and furnisheth himself with matter for it, ver. 7-10. (4.)
        Conscious of his own inability to praise God enough, he leaves it on
        God, to exalt and glorify himself, ver. 5-11.<br/><br/><br/>While I
        sing, let me cry aloud for mercy; let me lay my spiritual and temporal
        adversities before the Lord; and let me triumph in the God of my
        salvation; and employ him to glorify his name in all the earth.

      The righteous, when he vengeance sees,

      The righteous one shall wash his feet
      in blood of wicked men.

        This psalm was probably composed by David, when Saul carried on some
        kind of legal prosecution against him, which is not mentioned in the
        history of his reign. Here, (1.) He describes the corruption of these
        judges' government, in neglecting to do justice, and in readiness to
        do injustice; and the corruption of their nature, with their malice,
        falsehood, and obstinate untractableness, ver. 1-5. (2.) He prays that
        God would disable them to perpetrate mischief; would defeat their
        projects, and weaken their influence, ver. 6-8. (3.) He predicts their
        ruin, as calculated to promote the comfort of the godly, and the
        conviction of sinners, ver. 9-11.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me
        search out my corruptions, and bewail my obstinate refusals of Jesus
        Christ, and the counsels of his word. Let me dread the speedy, but
        awful vengeance of God, if I regard iniquity in my heart, or indulge
        it in my life.

      Do thou deliver me from them
      that work iniquity;

      For, lo, they for my soul lay wait:

      Against me, Lord; not for my fault,

      They run, and, without fault in me,

      Awake to meet me with thy help;

      To visit heathen all: spare none

      Them slay not, lest my folk forget;

      By thy strong pow'r; and bring them down,

      In wrath consume them, them consume,
      that so they may not be:
      And that in Jacob God doth rule

      At ev'ning let thou them return,
      making great noise and sound,
      Like to a dog, and often walk
      about the city round.

      And let them wander up and down,
      in seeking food to eat;
      And let them grudge when they shall not
      be satisfied with meat.

      But of thy pow'r I'll sing aloud;
      at morn thy mercy praise:
      For thou to me my refuge wast,

        This psalm was penned by David, when Saul sent messengers to watch his

        immediately preceding, we have, (1.) David's bitter complaints of his
        enemies, as wicked, barbarous, malicious, and atheistical, ver. 1-7.
        (2.) His predictory prayers that God would expose these enemies to
        contempt and derision; make them standing monuments of his just
        indignation; deal with them according to their sins; consume them in
        his wrath; and even render their sin their punishment, ver. 8, 10, 15.
        (3.) His holy resolutions to wait upon God, till his judgments should
        be executed upon them; and then to praise him for his protecting
        power, ver. 9-10, 16-17.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me think of
        the opposition made to David's Lord, and of the unrelenting vengeance
        which hath overtaken his enemies, Jewish and Heathen, and shall
        overtake his Antichristian and other opposers. While his honours are
        trampled under foot, let me wait on, and trust in God; that at last I
        may join in the hallelujahs of his people, when the smoke of his
        enemies' torment ascendeth up for ever and ever.

        contemplation of the late revival he had given to their affairs by his
        own accession to the throne, and victories over the Philistines,
        Moabites, etc., he beseeches God to grant them victory over, and rest
        from all their other enemies, ver. 4-5. (3.) In the confident
        expectation of God's fulfilment of his promises, along with the
        importunate supplication, he expresseth his triumphant hopes, that God
        would quickly subdue every enemy, the fortified cities of Edom not
        excepted, ver. 6-12.<br/><br/><br/>In all my distressed cases, let me

      Lord, thee my God, I'll early seek:
      my soul doth thirst for thee;
      My flesh longs in a dry parched land,
      wherein no waters be:

      That I thy powèr may behold,
      and brightness of thy face,
      As I have seen thee heretofore
      within thy holy place.

      Since better is thy love than life,
      my lips thee praise shall give.
      I in thy name will lift my hands,
      and bless thee while I live.

      Ev'n as with marrow and with fat
      my soul shall fillèd be;
      Then shall my mouth with joyful lips
      sing praises unto thee:

      When I do thee upon my bed
      remember with delight,
      And when on thee I meditate
      in watches of the night.

      In shadow of thy wings I'll joy,
      for thou mine help hast been.
      My soul thee follows hard; and me
      thy right hand doth sustain.

      Who seek my soul to spill shall sink
      down to earth's lowest room.
      They by the sword shall be cut off,
      and foxes' prey become.

      Yet shall the king in God rejoice,
      and each one glory shall
      That swear by him; but stopped shall be
      the mouth of liars all.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was penned by David, while he hid himself from the fury of
        Saul, in the wilderness of Judah, 1 Sam. 22:5; or 23:14, 24-25; or
        24:1; or, when he fled from Absalom, 2 Sam. 25-26. We have, (1.) His
        strong faith, working in ardent desires after the most familiar
        fellowship with God in public ordinances, ver. 1-2. (2.) His
        superlative estimation of God, issuing in hearty resolutions to be for
        ever employed in his praise, ver. 3-4. (3.) His heart-ravishing
        satisfaction in God, amidst secret and fixed meditation on his
        excellencies and love, ver. 5-6. (4.) His joyful dependence on God, as
        his Saviour and portion, ver. 7-8. (5.) His holy triumph in God, as
        his preserver, and the destroyer of his enemies, ver.
        9-11.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these high praises of God, let my
        soul be strong in the faith, giving glory to God; embracing the
        promise of himself, and calling all the fulness of the Godhead my own.
        Let me be all in raptures of divine love, and holy delight; let no
        guile, no corruption, no carnal care, enervate or damp my inward
        powers: but let all be opened, be wide stretched to grasp my infinite
        all - the great I Am.

      When I to thee my prayer make,
      Lord, to my voice give ear;
      My life save from the enemy,
      of whom I stand in fear.

      Me from their secret counsel hide
      who do live wickedly;
      From insurrection of those men
      that work iniquity:

      Who do their tongues with malice whet,
      and make them cut like swords;
      In whose bent bows are arrows set,
      ev'n sharp and bitter words:

      That they may at the perfect man
      in secret aim their shot;
      Yea, suddenly they dare at him
      to shoot, and fear it not.

      In ill encourage they themselves,
      and their snares close do lay:
      Together conference they have;
      Who shall them see? they say.

      They have searched out iniquities,
      a perfect search they keep:
      Of each of them the inward thought,
      and very heart, is deep.

      God shall an arrow shoot at them,
      and wound them suddenly:
      So their own tongue shall them confound;
      all who them see shall fly.

      And on all men a fear shall fall,
      God's works they shall declare;
      For they shall wisely notice take
      what these his doings are.

      In God the righteous shall rejoice,
      and trust upon his might;
      Yea, they shall greatly glory all
      in heart that are upright.

        This psalm contains, (1.) David's earnest supplications for
        preservation from his enemies, who were so spiteful in their
        calumnious reproaches; so close and subtile in their malicious plots;
        and so industrious and active, in executing their cruel projects, ver.
        1-6. (2.) His predictions, that God, by just vengeance, would quickly
        render these enemies a terror to themselves and others, and an
        occasion of holy joy and confidence to the saints, ver.
        7-10.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me commit my spiritual enemies
        into the hand of God, who is able to destroy them, and will quickly,
        to my everlasting comfort, tread them all under my feet.

      Praise waits for thee in Zion, Lord:
      to thee vows paid shall be.
      O thou that hearer art of pray'r,
      all flesh shall come to thee.

      Iniquities, I must confess,
      prevail against me do:
      But as for our transgrëssions,
      them purge away shalt thou.

      Bless'd is the man whom thou dost choose,
      and mak'st approach to thee,
      That he within thy courts, O Lord,
      may still a dweller be:

      We surely shall be satisfied
      with thy abundant grace,
      And with the goodness of thy house,
      ev'n of thy holy place.

      O God of our salvätion,
      thou, in thy righteousness,
      By fearful works unto our pray'rs
      thine answer dost express:

      Therefore the ends of all the earth,
      and those afar that be
      Upon the sea, their confidence,
      O Lord, will place in thee.

      Who, being girt with pow'r, sets fast
      by his great strength the hills.
      Who noise of seas, noise of their waves,
      and people's tumult, stills.

      Those in the utmost parts that dwell
      are at thy signs afraid:
      Th' outgoings of the morn and ev'n
      by thee are joyful made.

      The earth thou visit'st, wat'ring it;
      thou mak'st it rich to grow
      With God's full flood; thou corn prepar'st,
      when thou provid'st it so.

      Her rigs thou wat'rest plenteously,
      her furrows settelest:
      With show'rs thou dost her mollify,
      her spring by thee is blest.

      So thou the year most lib'rally
      dost with thy goodness crown;
      And all thy paths abundantly
      on us drop fatness down.

      They drop upon the pastures wide,
      that do in deserts lie;
      The little hills on ev'ry side
      rejoice right pleasantly.

      With flocks the pastures clothèd be,
      the vales with corn are clad;
      And now they shout and sing to thee,
      for thou hast made them glad.

        a deep sense of guilt and pollution, let me believe his unbounded
        forgiveness, and sanctifying influence. Let me come even to his seat,
        and enjoy ravishing fellowship with him. Let all my confidence be
        fixed on him; and, even in the blessings of Providence, let me discern
        the exceeding riches of his grace.

      Sing forth the honour of his name,

      Say unto God, How terrible
      in all thy works art thou!
      Through thy great pow'r thy foes to thee
      shall be constrained to bow.

      All on the earth shall worship thee,

      In's working to the sons of men
      most terrible is he.

      Into dry land the sea he turned,
      and they a passage had;

      He ruleth ever by his pow'r;

      Ye people, bless our God; aloud

      Our soul in life who safe preserves,

      For thou didst prove and try us, Lord,
      as men do silver try;
      Brought'st us into the net, and mad'st
      bands on our loins to lie.

      Thou hast caus'd men ride o'er our heads;
      and though that we did pass
      Through fire and water, yet thou brought'st
      us to a wealthy place.

      I'll bring burnt-off'rings to thy house;
      to thee my vows I'll pay,
      Which my lips uttered, my mouth spake,
      when trouble on me lay.

      Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams
      with incense I will bring;
      Of bullocks and of goats I will
      present an offering.

      All that fear God, come, hear, I'll tell
      what he did for my soul.
      I with my mouth unto him cried,
      my tongue did him extol.

      If in my heart I sin regard,
      the Lord me will not hear:
      But surely God me heard, and to
      my prayèr's voice gave ear.

      O let the Lord, our gracious God,
      for ever blessèd be,
      Who turnèd not my pray'r from him,

      Because the Lord a father is
      unto the fatherless;
      God is the widow's judge, within

      God doth the solitary set
      in fam'lies: and from bands
      The chained doth free; but rebels do

      O God, what time thou didst go forth
      before thy people's face;
      And when through the great wilderness
      thy glorious marching was;

      Then at God's presence shook the earth,
      then drops from heaven fell;
      This Sinai shook before the Lord,
      the God of Israel.

      O God, thou to thine heritage
      didst send a plenteous rain,
      Whereby thou, when it weary was,
      didst it refresh again.

      Thy congregation then did make
      their habitation there:
      Of thine own goodness for the poor,
      O God, thou didst prepare.

      The Lord himself did give the word,
      the word abroad did spread;
      Great was the company of them
      the same who publishèd.

      Kings of great armies foilèd were,
      and forced to flee away;
      And women, who remained at home,
      did distribute the prey.

      Though ye have lain among the pots,

      Whose wings with silver, and with gold
      whose feathers covered are.

      When there th' Almighty scattered kings,

      for aye will make abode.

      God's chariots twenty thousand are,
      thousands of angels strong;
      In 's holy place God is, as in

      Thou hast, O Lord, most glorious,
      ascended up on high;

      Thou hast receivèd gifts for men,
      for such as did rebel;
      Yea, ev'n for them, that God the LORD
      in midst of them might dwell.

      Bless'd be the Lord, who is to us
      of our salvation God;
      Who daily with his benefits
      us plenteously doth load.

      He of salvation is the God,
      who is our God most strong;
      And unto GOD the Lord from death
      the issues do belong.

      But surely God shall wound the head
      of those that are his foes;
      The hairy scalp of him that still
      on in his trespass goes.

      God said, My people I will bring
      again from Bashan hill;
      Yea, from the sea's devouring depths
      them bring again I will;

      That in the blood of enemies
      thy foot imbrued may be,
      And of thy dogs dipped in the same
      the tongues thou mayest see.

      Thy goings they have seen, O God;
      the steps of majesty
      Of my God, and my mighty King,
      within the sanctuary.

      Before went singers, players next
      on instruments took way;
      And them among the damsels were

      bless God with one accord:
      From Isr'el's fountain do ye bless
      and praise the mighty Lord.

      With their prince, little Benjamin,
      princes and council there
      Of Judah were, there Zabulon's
      and Napht'li's princes were.

      Thy God commands thy strength; make strong
      what thou wrought'st for us, Lord.
      For thy house at Jerusalem
      kings shall thee gifts afford.

      The spearmen's host, the multitude
      of bulls, which fiercely look,
      Those calves which people have forth sent,
      O Lord our God, rebuke,

      Till everyone submit himself,
      and silver pieces bring:
      The people that delight in war
      disperse, O God and King.

      Those that be princes great shall then
      come out of Egypt lands;
      And Ethiopia to God
      shall soon stretch out her hands.

      O all ye kingdoms of the earth,
      sing praises to this King;
      For he is Lord that ruleth all,
      unto him praises sing.

      To him that rides on heav'ns of heav'ns,
      which he of old did found;
      Lo, he sends out his voice, a voice
      in might that doth abound.

      Strength unto God do ye ascribe;
      for his excellency
      Is over Israèl, his strength
      is in the clouds most high.

      Thou 'rt from thy temple dreadful, Lord;

        and, in fine, for his superior dominion; his awful majesty; his mighty

      Those men that do without a cause
      bear hatred unto me,
      Than are the hairs upon my head
      in number more they be:

      They that would me destroy, and are
      mine en'mies wrongfully,
      Are mighty: so what I took not,
      to render forced was I.

      Lord, thou my folly know'st, my sins
      not covered are from thee.
      Let none that wait on thee be shamed,
      Lord God of hosts, for me.

      O Lord, the God of Israel,
      let none, who search do make,
      And seek thee, be at any time
      confounded for my sake.

      For I have borne reproach for thee,
      my face is hid with shame.
      To brethren strange, to mother's sons
      an alien I became.

      Because the zeal did eat me up,
      which to thine house I bear;
      And the reproaches cast at thee,
      upon me fallen are.

      My tears and fasts, t' afflict my soul,
      were turnèd to my shame.
      When sackcloth I did wear, to them
      a proverb I became.

      The men that in the gate do sit
      against me evil spake;
      They also that vile drunkards were
      of me their song did make.

      But, in an acceptàble time,
      my pray'r, LORD, is to thee:
      In truth of thy salvation, Lord,
      and mercy great, hear me.

      Deliver me out of the mire,
      from sinking do me keep;
      Free me from those that do me hate,
      and from the waters deep.

      Let not the flood on me prevail,
      whose water overflows;
      Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit
      her mouth upon me close.

      Hear me, O LORD, because thy love
      and kindness is most good;
      Turn unto me, according to
      thy mercies' multitude.

      Nor from thy servant hide thy face:
      I'm troubled, soon attend.
      Draw near my soul, and it redeem;
      me from my foes defend.

      To thee is my reproach well known,
      my shame, and my disgrace:
      Those that mine adversaries be
      are all before thy face.

      Reproach hath broke my heart; I'm full
      of grief: I looked for one
      To pity me, but none I found;
      comforters found I none.

      They also bitter gall did give
      unto me for my meat:
      They gave me vinegar to drink,
      when as my thirst was great.

      Before them let their table prove
      a snare; and do thou make
      Their welfare and prosperity
      a trap themselves to take.

      Let thou their eyes so darkened be,
      that sight may them forsake;
      And let their loins be made by thee
      continually to shake.

      Thy fury pour thou out on them,
      and indignätion;
      And let thy wrathful anger, Lord,
      fast hold take them upon.

      All waste and desolate let be
      their habitätion;
      And in their tabernacles all
      inhabitants be none.

      Because him they do persecute,
      whom thou didst smite before;
      They talk unto the grief of those
      whom thou hast wounded sore.

      Add thou iniquity unto
      their former wickedness;
      And do not let them come at all
      into thy righteousness.

      Out of the book of life let them
      be razed and blotted quite;
      Among the just and rïghteous
      let not their names be writ.

      But now become exceeding poor
      and sorrowful am I:
      By thy salvation, O my God,
      let me be set on high.

      The name of God I with a song
      most cheerfully will praise;
      And I, in giving thanks to him,
      his name shall highly raise.

      This to the LORD a sacrifice
      more gräcious shall prove
      Than bullock, ox, or any beast
      that hath both horn and hoof.

      When this the humble men shall see,
      it joy to them shall give:
      O all ye that do seek the Lord,
      your hearts shall ever live.

      For GOD the poor hears, and will not
      his prisoners contemn.
      Let heav'n, and earth, and seas, him praise,
      and all that move in them.

      For God will Judah's cities build,
      and he will Zion save,
      That they may dwell therein, and it
      in sure possession have.

      And they that are his servants' seed
      inherit shall the same;
      So shall they have their dwelling there
      that love his blessèd name.

        This psalm is much like the 22nd, representing at once the troubles of
        David and of David's Lord, and the glories which followed. We have in
        it, (1.) Bitter complaints of long and sore troubles; of the malice
        and multitude of enemies; of the unkindness of friends; of general
        contempt: and these mingled with candid acknowledgments of guilt, and
        with supplications for God's gracious audience and merciful
        deliverance, ver. 1-13. (2.) Pleas insisted on, in these
        supplications, viz. the mercy and truth of God; the psalmist's own
        great distress; the insolence and cruelty of his enemies; and the
        unkindness of his friends, ver. 14-21. (3.) Predictions of the ruin of
        David's, and especially of Christ's Jewish enemies; importing that
        their sacrifices and their common food should be cursed to them; that
        they should be plagued with judicial blindness and wrathful disquiet;
        that they should be rendered public monuments of the vengeance of God,
        having their church and state quite unhinged, and their land
        desolated; and, in fine, that their ruin should be increasing, and
        their recovery almost impossible, ver. 22-28. (4.) Under a deep sense
        of his poverty and distress, David, and his divine Son, celebrate the
        high praises of God, and call others to praise him for the
        deliverances of Israel; but chiefly for the erection of the gospel
        church, and for the certain, though still future recalling of the Jews
        into the same, ver. 29-36.<br/><br/><br>While I sing, let me behold my
        Redeemer, charged in law with my sins, and bearing the punishment
        thereof. Let me learn with patience to run the race of holy obedience
        and of necessary trials set before me, looking to Jesus as my pattern,
        and as the author and finisher of my faith. While I behold the
        tremendous severity of God's judgments against his ancient people, for
        rejecting and murdering his Son, let me not be high -minded, but fear.
        Let me behold the grace of our Lord Jesus, who, though he was rich,
        yet for our sakes he became poor; that we through his poverty might be
        made rich. And let me be a living and lively member of that church
        which is founded in his blood, and blessed in him with all spiritual
        blessings.

      O LORD, my hope and confidence
      is placed in thee alone;
      Then let thy servant never be
      put to confüsion.

      And let me, in thy righteousness,
      from thee deliv'rance have;
      Cause me escape, incline thine ear
      unto me, and me save.

      Be thou my dwelling-rock, to which
      I ever may resort:
      Thou gav'st commandment me to save,
      for thou'rt my rock and fort.

      Free me, my God, from wicked hands,
      hands cruel and unjust:
      For thou, O Lord GOD, art my hope,
      and from my youth my trust.

      Thou from the womb didst hold me up;
      thou art the same that me
      Out of my mother's bowels took;
      I ever will praise thee.

      To many I a wonder am;
      but thou'rt my refuge strong.
      Filled let my mouth be with thy praise
      and honour all day long.

      O do not cast me off, when as
      old age doth overtake me;
      And when my strength decayèd is,
      then do not thou forsake me.

      For those that are mine enemies
      against me speak with hate;
      And they together counsel take
      that for my soul lay wait.

      They said, God leaves him; him pursue
      and take: none will him save.
      Be thou not far from me, my God:
      thy speedy help I crave.

      Confound, consume them, that unto
      my soul are enemies:
      Clothed be they with reproach and shame
      that do my hurt devise.

      But I with expectätion
      will hope continually;
      And yet with praises more and more
      I will thee magnify.

      Thy justice and salvätion
      my mouth abroad shall show,
      Ev'n all the day; for I thereof
      the numbers do not know.

      And I will constantly go on
      in strength of GOD the Lord;
      And thine own righteousness, ev'n thine
      alone, I will record.

      For even from my youth, O God,
      by thee I have been taught;
      And hitherto I have declared
      the wonders thou hast wrought.

      And now, Lord, leave me not, when I
      old and grey-headed grow:
      Till to this age thy strength and pow'r
      to all to come I show.

      And thy most perfect righteousness,
      O Lord, is very high,
      Who has so great things done: O God,
      who is like unto thee?

      Thou, Lord, who great adversities,
      and sore, to me didst show,
      Shalt quicken, and bring me again
      from depths of earth below.

      My greatness and my pow'r thou wilt
      increase, and far extend:
      On ev'ry side against all grief
      thou wilt me comfort send.

      Thee, ev'n thy truth, I'll also praise,
      my God, with psaltery:
      Thou Holy One of Israel,
      with harp I'll sing to thee.

      My lips shall much rejoice in thee,
      when I thy praises sound;
      My soul, which thou redeemèd hast,
      in joy shall much abound.

      My tongue thy justice shall proclaim,
      continuing all day long;
      For they confounded are, and shamed,
      that seek to do me wrong.

        This psalm was probably penned on the occasion of Absalom's rebellion,
        as Psalm 3rd, 42nd, 43rd; or of Sheba's conspiracy, 2 Sam. 20. It
        contains, (1.) David's firm confidence in God, encouraged by manifold
        experiences of his gracious kindness, ver. 1, 3, 5-7. (2.) His fervent
        prayers that he might never be ashamed, but might be delivered; might
        find rest in God; might have constant matter of new praises and
        thanksgivings afforded him; might not be forsaken of God in his old
        age; and might have his numerous, powerful, and crafty enemies,
        confounded with shame and perplexity, ver. 1-13, 18. (3.) His
        confident and joyful expectations of God's further kindness,
        particularly that God would never forsake, but revive him; that he
        would increase his honour and comfort, and put his enemies to shame:
        Along with which he resolves, with admiring rapture, to extol God's
        righteousness and salvation, and his new-covenant relation to himself,
        and to Israel, ver. 14-24.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me be
        affected with my troubles. Let me never stagger at the promise through
        unbelief, but be strong in the faith, giving glory to God.

      O Lord, thy judgments give the king,

      The lofty mountains shall bring forth
      unto the people peace;
      Likewise the little hills the same
      shall do by righteousness.

      The people's poor ones he shall judge,

      who them oppressèd have.

      They shall thee fear, while sun and moon

      His large and great dominion shall

      The poor man and the indigent
      in mercy he shall spare;
      He shall preserve alive the souls

      Of corn an handful in the earth

      The city shall be flourishing,

        This psalm was composed by David, about the time of Solomon's
        instalment in the throne of Israel, 1 Kings 1 and 2. With respect to
        him, here is, (1.) Fervent prayer for proper qualifications to furnish
        him for government, ver. 1. (2.) Predictions of the peace, glory,
        extent, wealth, duration and happiness of his government, ver. 2-17.
        (3.) Praise to the God of Israel for his mercies to his people, ver.
        18-19. But as our Redeemer is principally intended, we have concerning
        him, (1.) His being furnished with the Holy Ghost above measure, to
        qualify him for his work, ver. 1. (2.) The glories of his government;
        how righteous, how prudent, how orderly, how condescending and
        merciful! how destructive to oppressors, how efficaciously productive
        to real religion, and how comfortable to his faithful subjects his
        administrations are! ver. 2-9. How extensive his church, among all
        ranks and nations; how tender his care of the meanest of his subjects;
        how much he is revered and adored by them; how astonishing their
        increase, by means of his gospel truth preached; and how permanent and
        useful his government! ver. 10-17. (3.) A solemn ascription of all the
        praise of these wonderful works to God alone, with an earnest request
        and believing expectation, that his glory shall fill the whole earth,
        ver. 18-19.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these lofty notes of the dying
        psalmist, let me admire, let me adore, let me sing praises to Jesus my
        King. Let me rejoice in his highness and in his extensive usefulness
        to men.

      Yet God is good to Israel,
      to each pure-hearted one.
      But as for me, my steps near slipped,
      my feet were almost gone.

      For I envìous was, and grudged
      the foolish folk to see,
      When I perceived the wicked sort
      enjoy prosperity.

      For still their strength continueth firm;
      their death of bands is free.
      They are not toiled like other men,
      nor plagued, as others be.

      Therefore their pride, like to a chain,
      them compasseth about;
      And, as a garment, violence
      doth cover them throughout.

      Their eyes stand out with fat; they have
      more than their hearts could wish.
      They are corrupt; their talk of wrong
      both lewd and lofty is.

      They set their mouth against the heav'ns
      in their blasphemous talk;
      And their reproaching tongue throughout
      the earth at large doth walk.

      His people oftentimes for this
      look back, and turn about;
      Sith waters of so full a cup
      to these are pourèd out.

      And thus they say, How can it be
      that God these things doth know?
      Or, Can there in the Highest be
      knowledge of things below?

      Behold, these are the wicked ones,
      yet prosper at their will
      In worldly things; they do increase
      in wealth and riches still.

      I verily have done in vain
      my heart to purify;
      To no effect in innocence
      washèd my hands have I.

      For daily, and all day throughout,
      great plagues I suffered have;
      Yea, ev'ry morning I of new
      did chastisement receive.

      If in this manner foolishly
      to speak I would intend,
      Thy children's generätion,
      behold, I should offend.

      When I this thought to know, it was
      too hard a thing for me;
      Till to God's sanctuary I went,
      then I their end did see.

      Assuredly thou didst them set
      a slipp'ry place upon;
      Them suddenly thou castedst down
      into destrüction.

      How in a moment suddenly
      to ruin brought are they!
      With fearful terrors utterly
      they are consumed away.

      Ev'n like unto a dream, when one
      from sleeping doth arise;
      So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,
      their image shalt despise.

      Thus grievèd was my heart in me,
      and me my reins oppressed:
      So rude was I, and ignorant,
      and in thy sight a beast.

      Nevertheless continually,
      O Lord, I am with thee:
      Thou dost me hold by my right hand,
      and still upholdest me.

      Thou, with thy counsel, while I live,
      wilt me conduct and guide;
      And to thy glory afterward
      receive me to abide.

      Whom have I in the heavens high
      but thee, O Lord, alone?
      And in the earth whom I desire
      besides thee there is none.

      My flesh and heart doth faint and fail,
      but God doth fail me never:
      For of my heart God is the strength
      and pörtion for ever.

      For, lo, they that are far from thee
      for ever perish shall;
      Them that a whoring from thee go
      thou hast destroyèd all.

      But surely it is good for me
      that I draw near to God:
      In GOD I trust, that all thy works
      I may declare abroad.

    commentary:

        This psalm, and the ten following, are called Psalms of Asaph; but
        whether because he composed most of them, or because he led the music
        in singing them, is not altogether certain. Here we have, (1.) The
        great foundation of all religion, viz. the goodness of God to his
        people, strongly asserted, ver. 1. (2.) The psalmist's faith fearfully
        shaken by the consideration of the freedom, prosperity, plenty, and
        peaceful-like death of the wicked; which rendered them proud,
        oppressive, insolent, atheistical, and profane; while himself was in a
        manner consigned to nothing but trouble, ver. 2-13. (3.) The
        temptation, when it had reduced him to the brink of atheism, is
        broken, by a discovery of the connected purposes and providences of
        God in his word and ordinances, ver. 14-20. (4.) His improvement of
        his fall and recovery, to promote a deep sense of his own meanness,
        ignorance, and folly; a complete dependence on God as his guide; a
        cleaving to him as his portion, infinitely preferable to every thing
        else; without whom one is necessarily miserable, and in the enjoyment
        of whom he is assured of happiness, and excited to praise and
        thanksgiving, ver. 21-28.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me remember
        my own wickedness and folly; and let me receive instruction in duty.
        Let me cleave to God as my portion, and resolve to draw my light and
        comfort from the oracles of his mouth, and ordinances of his grace.

      O God, why hast thou cast us off?
      is it for evermore?
      Against thy pasture-sheep why doth
      thine anger smoke so sore?

      O call to thy rememberance
      thy congregätion,
      Which thou hast purchasèd of old;
      still think the same upon:

      The rod of thine inheritance,
      which thou redeemèd hast,
      This Zion hill, wherein thou hadst
      thy dwelling in times past.

      To these long desolätions
      thy feet lift, do not tarry;
      For all the ills thy foes have done
      within thy sanctuary.

      Amidst thy congregätions
      thine enemies do roar:
      Their ensigns they set up for signs
      of triumph thee before.

      A man was famous, and was had
      in estimätion,
      According as he lifted up
      his axe thick trees upon.

      But all at once with axes now
      and hammers they go to,
      And down the carvèd work thereof
      they break, and quite undo.

      They firèd have thy sanctuary,
      and have defiled the same,
      By casting down unto the ground
      the place where dwelt thy name.

      Thus said they in their hearts, Let us
      destroy them out of hand:
      They burnt up all the synagogues
      of God within the land.

      Our signs we do not now behold;
      there is not us among
      A prophet more, nor any one
      that knows the time how long.

      How long, Lord, shall the enemy
      thus in reproach exclaim?
      And shall the adversary thus
      always blaspheme thy name?

      Thy hand, ev'n thy right hand of might,
      why dost thou thus draw back?
      O from thy bosom pluck it out
      for our deliv'rance' sake.

      For certainly God is my King,
      ev'n from the times of old,
      Working in midst of all the earth
      salvation manifold.

      The sea, by thy great pow'r, to part
      asunder thou didst make;
      And thou the dragons' heads, O Lord,
      within the waters brake.

      The leviathan's head thou brak'st
      in pieces, and didst give
      Him to be meat unto the folk
      in wilderness that live.

      Thou clav'st the fountain and the flood,
      which did with streams abound:
      Thou dri'dst the mighty waters up
      unto the very ground.

      Thine only is the day, O Lord,
      thine also is the night;
      And thou alone preparèd hast
      the sun and shining light.

      By thee the borders of the earth
      were settled everywhere:
      The summer and the winter both
      by thee created were.

      That th' enemy reproachèd hath,
      O keep it in record;
      And that the foolish people have
      blasphemed thy name, O LORD.

      Unto the multitude do not
      thy turtle's soul deliver:
      The congregation of thy poor
      do not forget for ever.

      Unto thy cov'nant have respect;
      for earth's dark places be
      Full of the habitätions
      of horrid cruelty.

      O let not those that be oppressed
      return again with shame:
      Let those that poor and needy are
      give praise unto thy name.

      Do thou, O God, arise and plead
      the cause that is thine own:
      Remember how thou art reproached
      still by the foolish one.

      Do not forget the voice of those
      that are thine enemies:
      Of those the tumult ever grows
      that do against thee rise.

    commentary:

        This psalm relates to the destruction of the city and temple of
        Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, or to some similar disaster. In it we
        have, (1.) The church's bitter complaints of God's displeasure; of the
        outrage of her enemies; and of the apparent hopelessness of her case,
        ver. 1-11. (2.) Strong and heart-encouraging pleadings with God, upon
        the account of his relation to his people, and of the great things he
        had done for them, and that he was at once their God and the God of
        nature; that therefore he would remember to execute just vengeance
        upon his sworn enemies, and grant help and relief to his covenant
        people, ver. 12-23.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing this, let me admire the
        sovereignty and holiness of God, in so severely correcting his own
        people. And let the broken, the deserted condition of the church, in
        this land, deeply affect my heart, and excite my earnest prayers for
        her restoration.

      To thee, O God, do we give thanks,
      we do give thanks to thee;
      Because thy wondrous works declare
      thy great name near to be.

      I purpose, when I shall receive
      the congregätion,
      That I shall judgment uprightly
      render to everyone.

      Dissolvèd is the land, with all
      that in the same do dwell;
      But I the pillars thereof do
      bear up, and stablish well.

      I to the foolish people said,
      Do not deal foolishly;
      And unto those that wicked are,
      Lift not your horn on high.

      Lift not your horn on high, nor speak
      with stubborn neck. But know,
      That not from east, nor west, nor south,
      promötion doth flow.

      But God is judge; he puts down one,
      and sets another up.
      For in the hand of GOD most high
      of red wine is a cup:

      'Tis full of mixture, he pours forth,
      and makes the wicked all
      Wring out the bitter dregs thereof;
      yea, and they drink them shall.

      But I for ever will declare,
      I Jacob's God will praise.
      All horns of lewd men I'll cut off;
      but just men's horns will raise.

        Here, (1.) David returns thanks to God for advancing him to the throne
        of Israel, and resolves to act for the public welfare, ver. 1-3, 9-10.
        (2.) He rebukes the insolence of such as opposed his advancement,
        which sprung from the sovereign disposal of God, the judge of the
        world, and denounceth their destruction, ver. 4-8.<br/><br/><br/>While
        I sing, let me think of Jesus, whom God hath crowned with glory and
        honour, and of the infinite danger of opposing his government. And if

      In Judah's land God is well known,
      his name 's in Isr'el great:
      In Salem is his tabernacle,
      in Zion is his seat.

      There arrows of the bow he brake,
      the shield, the sword, the war.
      More glorious thou than hills of prey,
      more excellent art far.

      Those that were stout of heart are spoiled,
      they slept their sleep outright;
      And none of those their hands did find,
      that were the men of might.

      When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,
      had forth against them past,
      Their horses and their chariots both
      were in a deep sleep cast.

      Thou, Lord, ev'n thou art he that should
      be feared; and who is he
      That may stand up before thy sight,
      if once thou angry be?

      From heav'n thou judgment caused be heard;
      the earth was still with fear,
      When God to judgment rose, to save
      all meek on earth that were.

      Surely the very wrath of man
      unto thy praise redounds:
      Thou to the remnant of his wrath
      wilt set restraining bounds.

      Vow to the LORD your God, and pay:
      all ye that near him be,
      Bring gifts and presents unto him;
      for to be feared is he.

      By him the spirits shall be cut off

        This psalm is like to the 48th, and was penned on occasion of some
        remarkable victory; but whether in the days of David, Asa,
        Jehoshaphat, or Hezekiah (2 Chron. 14, 20, 32), is uncertain. We have
        in it, (1.) Encouraging congratulations of the church's happiness, in
        having God so manifested in her, and so near unto her; and in having
        his power so employed in her behalf, to the advancement of his own
        glory, and the destruction of her enemies, ver. 1-6. (2.) Important
        instructions how to improve this victory, to the terror of enemies,
        the comfort of saints, and the excitement of all to vow to God, and to
        obey and revere him, ver. 7-12.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing this psalm,
        let my soul bless the Lord, that my lot hath been always cast in a
        land of gospel light. Let me, with thankful heart, remember what he
        hath done for this church and land; and give him the praise of every
        deliverance. Let me never fear the rage of men; but in every danger
        and doubt commit my way to God, that he may bring it to pass.

      Unto the Lord I with my voice,
      I unto God did cry;
      Ev'n with my voice, and unto me
      his ear he did apply.

      I in my trouble sought the Lord,
      my sore by night did run,
      And ceasèd not; my grievèd soul
      did consolation shun.

      I to remembrance God did call,
      yet trouble did remain;
      And overwhelmed my spirit was,
      whilst I did sore complain.

      Mine eyes, debarred from rest and sleep,
      thou makest still to wake;
      My trouble is so great that I
      unable am to speak.

      The days of old to mind I called,
      and oft did think upon
      The times and ages that are past
      full many years agone.

      By night my song I call to mind,
      and commune with my heart;
      My spirit did carefully enquire
      how I might ease my smart.

      For ever will the Lord cast off,
      and gracious be no more?
      For ever is his mercy gone?
      fails his word evermore?

      Is 't true that to be gräcious
      the Lord forgotten hath?
      And that his tender mercies he
      hath shut up in his wrath?

      Then did I say, That surely this
      is mine infirmity:
      I'll mind the years of the right hand
      of him that is most High.

      Yea, I remember will the works
      performèd by the LORD:
      The wonders done of old by thee
      I surely will record.

      I also will of all thy works
      my meditation make;
      And of thy doings to discourse
      great pleasure I will take.

      O God, thy way most holy is
      within thy sanctuary;
      And what God is so great in pow'r
      as is our God most high?

      Thou art the God that wonders do'st
      by thy right hand most strong:
      Thy mighty pow'r thou hast declared
      the nätions among.

      To thine own people with thine arm
      thou didst redemption bring;
      To Jacob's sons, and to the tribes
      of Joseph that do spring.

      The waters, Lord, perceivèd thee,
      the waters saw thee well;
      And they for fear aside did flee;
      the depths on trembling fell.

      The clouds in water forth were poured,
      sound loudly did the sky;
      And swiftly through the world abroad
      thine arrows fierce did fly.

      Thy thunder's voice alongst the heav'n
      a mighty noise did make;
      By lightnings lighten'd was the world,
      th' earth tremble did and shake.

      Thy way is in the sea, and in
      the waters great thy path;
      Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord;
      none knowledge thereof hath.

      Thy people thou didst safely lead,
      like to a flock of sheep;
      By Moses' hand and Aaron's thou
      didst them conduct and keep.

        This psalm relates to, (1.) A most afflicted case, in which are
        remarkable, fervent, and incessant prayers, agonizing restlessness,
        heart-overwhelming meditations, melancholy fears, and almost desperate
        outcries, concerning God, ver. 1-9. (2.) The effectual cure of this
        mournful case, by serious meditation on, and solemn acknowledgment of
        the power, greatness, and grace of God, as our God; and of the
        holiness and mysteriousness of his providential conduct; particularly
        in bringing Israel out of Egypt, and leading them through the
        wilderness, to the promised land, ver. 10-20.<br/><br/><br/>While I
        sing, let me stand in awe of that God, who so chastiseth his favourite

        great works of my God, for his church, or for my soul.

      Attend, my people, to my law;
      thereto give thou an ear;
      The words that from my mouth proceed
      attentively do hear.

      My mouth shall speak a parable,
      and sayings dark of old;
      The same which we have heard and known,
      and us our fathers told.

      We also will them not conceal
      from their posterity;
      Them to the generätion
      to come declare will we:

      The praises of the LORD our God,
      and his almighty strength,
      The wondrous works that he hath done,
      we will show forth at length.

      His testimony and his law
      in Isr'el he did place,
      And charged our fathers it to show
      to their succeeding race;

      That so the race which was to come
      might well them learn and know;
      And sons unborn, who should arise,
      might to their sons them show:

      That they might set their hope in God,
      and suffer not to fall
      His mighty works out of their mind,
      but keep his precepts all:

      And might not, like their fathers, be
      a stiff rebellious race;
      A race not right in heart; with God
      whose spirit not stedfast was.

      The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows
      nor other arms did lack,
      When as the day of battle was,
      they faintly turnèd back.

      They brake God's cov'nant, and refused
      in his commands to go;
      His works and wonders they forgot,
      which he to them did show.

      Things marvellous he brought to pass;
      their fathers them beheld
      Within the land of Egypt done,
      yea, ev'n in Zoàn's field.

      By him divided was the sea,
      he caused them through to pass;
      And made the waters so to stand,
      as like an heap it was.

      With cloud by day, with light of fire
      all night, he did them guide.
      In desert rocks he clave, and drink,
      as from great depths, supplied.

      He from the rock brought streams, like floods
      made waters to run down.
      Yet sinning more, in desert they
      provoked the Highest One.

      For in their heart they tempted God,
      and, speaking with mistrust,
      They greedily did meat require
      to satisfy their lust.

      Against the Lord himself they spake,
      and, murmuring, said thus,
      A table in the wilderness
      can God prepare for us?

      Behold, he smote the rock, and thence
      came streams and waters great;
      But can he give his people bread?
      and send them flesh to eat?

      The LORD did hear, and waxèd wroth;
      so kindled was a flame
      'Gainst Jacob, and 'gainst Israel
      up indignation came.

      For they believed not God, nor trust
      in his salvation had;
      Though clouds above he did command,
      and heav'n's doors open made,

      And manna rained on them, and gave
      them corn of heav'n to eat.
      Man angels' food did eat; to them
      he to the full sent meat.

      And in the heaven he did cause
      an eastern wind to blow;
      And by his powèr he let out
      the southern wind to go.

      Then flesh as thick as dust he made
      to rain down them among;
      And feathered fowls, like as the sand
      which lieth the shore along.

      At his command amidst their camp
      these show'rs of flesh down fell,
      All round about the tabernacles
      and tents where they did dwell.

      So they did eat abundantly,
      and had of meat their fill;
      For he did give to them what was
      their own desire and will.

      They from their lust had not estranged
      their heart and their desire;
      But while the meat was in their mouths,
      which they did so require,

      God's wrath upon them came, and slew
      the fattest of them all;
      So that the choice of Israel,
      o'erthrown by death, did fall.

      Yet, notwithstanding of all this,
      they sinnèd still the more;
      And though he had great wonders wrought,
      believed him not therefor:

      Wherefore their days in vanity
      he did consume and waste;
      And by his wrath their wretched years
      away in trouble past.

      But when he slew them, then they did
      to seek him show desire;
      Yea, they returned, and after God
      right early did enquire.

      And that the Lord had been their Rock
      they did remember then;
      Ev'n that the high almighty God
      had their Redeemer been.

      Yet with their mouth they flattered him,
      and spake but feignèdly;
      And they unto the God of truth
      with their false tongues did lie.

      For though their words were good, their heart
      with him was not sincere;
      Unstedfast and perfidious
      they in his cov'nant were.

      But, full of pity, he forgave
      their sin, them did not slay;
      Nor stirred up all his wrath, but oft
      his anger turned away.

      For that they were but fading flesh
      to mind he did recall;
      A wind that passeth soon away,
      and not returns at all.

      How often did they him provoke
      within the wilderness!
      And in the desert did him grieve
      with their rebelliousness!

      Yea, turning back, they tempted God,
      and limits set upon
      Him, who in midst of Isr'el is
      the only Holy One.

      They did not call to mind his pow'r,
      not yet the day when he
      Delivered them out of the hand
      of their fierce enemy;

      Nor how great signs in Egypt land
      he openly had wrought;
      What miracles in Zoàn's field
      his hand to pass had brought.

      How lakes and rivers everywhere
      he turnèd into blood;
      So that nor man nor beast could drink
      of standing lake or flood.

      He brought among them swarms of flies,
      which did them sore annoy;
      And divers kinds of filthy frogs
      he sent them to destroy.

      He to the caterpillar gave
      the fruits of all their soil;
      Their labours he delivered up
      unto the locusts' spoil.

      Their vines with hail, their sycamores
      he with the frost did blast:
      Their beasts to hail he gave; their flocks
      hot thunderbolts did waste.

      Fierce burning wrath he on them cast,
      and indignation strong,
      And troubles sore, by sending forth
      ill angels them among.

      He to his wrath made way; their soul
      from death he did not save;
      But over to the pestilence
      the lives of them he gave.

      In Egypt land the first-born all
      he smote down everywhere;
      Among the tents of Ham, ev'n these
      chief of their strength that were.

      But his own people, like to sheep,
      thence to go forth he made;
      And he, amidst the wilderness,
      them, as a flock, did lead.

      And he them safely on did lead,
      so that they did not fear;
      Whereas their en'mies by the sea
      quite overwhelmèd were.

      To borders of his sanctuary
      the Lord his people led,
      Ev'n to the mount which his right hand
      for them had purchasèd.

      The nätions of Canàan,
      by his almighty hand,
      Before their face he did expel
      out of their native land;

      Which for inheritance to them
      by line he did divide,
      And made the tribes of Israel
      within their tents abide.

      Yet God Most High they did provoke,
      and tempted ever still;
      And to observe his test'monies
      did not incline their will:

      But, like their fathers, turnèd back,
      and dealt unfaithfully:
      Aside they turnèd, like a bow
      that shoots deceitfully.

      For they to anger did provoke
      him with their places high;
      And with their graven images
      moved him to jealousy.

      When God heard this, he waxèd wroth,
      and much loathed Isr'el then:
      So Shiloh's tent he left, the tent
      which he had placed with men.

      And he his strength deliverèd
      into captivity;
      He left his glory in the hand
      of his proud enemy.

      His people also he gave o'er
      unto the sword's fierce rage:
      So sore his wrath inflamèd was
      against his heritage.

      The fire consumed their choice young men;
      their maids no marriage had;
      And when their priests fell by the sword,
      their wives no mourning made.

      But then the Lord arose, as one
      that doth from sleep awake;
      And like a giant that, by wine
      refreshed, a shout doth make:

      Upon his en'mies' hinder parts
      he made his stroke to fall;
      And so upon them he did put
      a shame perpetuàl.

      Moreover, he the tabernacle
      of Joseph did refuse;
      The mighty tribe of Ephraim
      he would in no wise choose:

      But he did choose Jehudah's tribe
      to be the rest above;
      And of mount Zion he made choice,
      which he so much did love.

      And he his sanctuary built
      like to a palace high,
      Like to the earth which he did found
      to perpetuity.

      Of David, that his servant was,
      he also choice did make,
      And even from the folds of sheep
      was pleasèd him to take:

      From waiting on the ewes with young,
      he brought him forth to feed
      Israèl, his inheritance,
      his people, Jacob's seed.

      So after the integrity
      he of his heart them fed;
      And by the good skill of his hands
      them wisely governèd.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm is but a brief instructive history of the transactions
        between Israel and their God, for about four hundred and eighty years,
        from Moses to David. Here is, (1.) The introduction, containing a
        solemn call to an attentive consideration of God's words and works, in
        order to a faithful transmitting of the knowledge thereof to
        posterity, that they might set their hope in God, and reform from
        their fathers' wickedness, ver. 1-8. (2.) The history itself, in which
        are exhibited, 1. God's favours to Israel before their settlement in
        Canaan, in plaguing the Egyptians; in dividing the Red Sea; in giving
        them water from the rock, and manna from heaven; in bringing them into
        Canaan, notwithstanding their unnumbered provocations, particularly
        their forgetfulness of his mighty works, their ingratitude for his
        favours, their murmuring against his trying dispensations, their
        eagerness to satiate their lusts with his benefits, their impenitent
        obduracy, or hypocritical repentance under his rebukes, ver. 9-55. 2.
        Their ingratitude, treachery, and idolatry, after their entrance into
        Canaan; with God's righteous resentment thereof, in removing his
        tabernacle from Shiloh, and in delivering up his ark and people into
        the hand of the Philistines, ver. 56-64. 3. God's merciful return to
        them, in obliging the Philistines, by the plague of emrods, to restore
        his ark; in at length providing an habitation for it at Jerusalem; and
        in raising up and qualifying David, a descendant of Judah, to govern
        them in a manner both honourable and happy, ver. 65-72. These things
        are more largely recorded in the books of Exodus, Numbers,
        Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1st and 2nd Samuel, and part of 1st
        Kings.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me, with grief and shame,
        remember my own and my fathers' transgressions against the Lord. Let
        me adore the infinite patience, power, and mercy, holiness and equity
        of God. Let me bless his holy name, for the multitude of his
        undeserved favours towards me, and towards the church. And though he
        cause grief, let me hope that, in due time, he will have compassion.

      O God, the heathen entered have
      thine heritage; by them
      Defilèd is thy house: on heaps
      they laid Jerusalem.

      The bodies of thy servants they
      have cast forth to be meat
      To rav'nous fowls; thy dear saints' flesh
      they gave to beasts to eat.

      Their blood about Jerusalem
      like water they have shed;
      And there was none to bury them
      when they were slain and dead.

      Unto our neighbours a reproach
      most base become are we;
      A scorn and laughingstock to them
      that round about us be.

      How long, LORD, shall thine anger last?
      wilt thou still keep the same?
      And shall thy fervent jealousy
      burn like unto a flame?

      On heathen pour thy fury forth,
      that have thee never known,
      And on those kingdoms which thy name
      have never called upon.

      For these are they who Jacob have
      devourèd cruelly;
      And they his habitätion
      have causèd waste to lie.

      Against us mind not former sins;
      thy tender mercies show;
      Let them prevent us speedily,
      for we're brought very low.

      For thy name's glory help us, Lord,
      who hast our Saviour been:
      Deliver us; for thy name's sake,
      O purge away our sin.

      Why say the heathen, Where's their God?
      let him to them be known;
      When those who shed thy servants' blood
      are in our sight o'erthrown.

      O let the pris'ner's sighs ascend
      before thy sight on high;
      Preserve those in thy mighty pow'r
      that are designed to die.

      And to our neighbours' bosom cause
      it sev'n-fold rendered be,
      Ev'n the reproach wherewith they have,
      O Lord, reproachèd thee.

      So we thy folk, and pasture-sheep,
      shall give thee thanks always;
      And unto generations all
      we will show forth thy praise.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm relates to the havoc made of the Jewish capital and nation,
        by the Chaldeans and Syro-Grecians, as typical of the afflictions of
        the gospel church. Observe, (1.) How deplorable the condition of these
        people of God was, when their enemies raged against their dwellings,
        persons, and characters; and their God himself long continued the
        tokens of his just displeasure, ver. 1-5. (2.) Their humble, but
        fervent supplications, for the just punishment of their heathen
        enemies; and for divine pity, pardon, and help to themselves, ver.
        6-12. (3.) The pleas wherewith they enforce their requests, viz. God's
        relation to them, as their God and shepherd; and the tendency of what
        they asked to promote the declarative glory of his name, ver. 1, 6,
        9-10, 13.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let my soul have a deep sympathy
        with the afflicted members of Christ. Let me bless his holy name, that
        I am not in similar circumstances. Let me lay before the Lord the
        spiritual injuries which Satan and my lusts have done to my soul, and
        to the church of God; and let me cry earnestly for his merciful rising
        up to destroy them, and to show me his salvation.

      Hear, Isr'el's Shepherd! like a flock
      thou that dost Joseph guide;
      Shine forth, O thou that dost between
      the cherubims abide.

      In Ephraim's and Benjamin's,
      and in Manasseh's sight,
      O come for our salvätion;
      stir up thy strength and might.

      Turn us again, O Lord our God,
      and upon us vouchsafe
      To make thy countenance to shine,
      and so we shall be safe.

      O LORD of hosts, almighty God,
      how long shall kindled be
      Thy wrath against the prayer made
      by thine own folk to thee?

      Thou tears of sorrow giv'st to them
      instead of bread to eat;
      Yea, tears instead of drink thou giv'st
      to them in measure great.

      Thou makest us a strife unto
      our neighbours round about;
      Our enemies among themselves
      at us do laugh and flout.

      Turn us again, O God of hosts,
      and upon us vouchsafe
      To make thy countenance to shine,
      and so we shall be safe.

      A vine from Egypt brought thou hast,
      by thine outstretchèd hand;
      And thou the heathen out didst cast
      to plant it in their land.

      Before it thou a room didst make,
      where it might grow and stand;
      Thou causedst it deep root to take,
      and it did fill the land.

      The mountains veiled were with its shade,
      as with a covering;
      Like goodly cedars were the boughs
      which out from it did spring.

      Upon the one hand to the sea
      her boughs she did out send;
      On th' other side unto the flood
      her branches did extend.

      Why hast thou then thus broken down,
      and ta'en her hedge away?
      So that all passengers do pluck,
      and make of her a prey.

      The boar who from the forest comes
      doth waste it at his pleasure;
      The wild beast of the field also
      devours it out of measure.

      O God of hosts, we thee beseech,
      return now unto thine;
      Look down from heav'n in love, behold,
      and visit this thy vine:

      This vineyard, which thine own right hand
      hath planted us among;
      And that same branch, which for thyself
      thou hast made to be strong.

      Burnt up it is with flaming fire,
      it also is cut down:
      They utterly are perishèd,
      when as thy face doth frown.

      O let thy hand be still upon
      the Man of thy right hand,
      The Son of man, whom for thyself
      thou madest strong to stand.

      So henceforth we will not go back,
      nor turn from thee at all:
      O do thou quicken us, and we
      upon thy name will call.

      Turn us again, LORD God of hosts,
      and upon us vouchsafe
      To make thy countenance to shine,
      and so we shall be safe.

    commentary:

        This psalm relates to the distressed condition of the Hebrew church
        and nation, perhaps during the Syrian, Assyrian, or Chaldean
        invasions, 2 Kings 12-13, 15, 17-19, 24-25. Here are, (1.) Earnest
        supplications for God's special presence and favour, ver. 1-3, 7, 19.
        (2.) Mournful complaints of the lasting appearances of God's anger; of
        the overflowings of their grief; of abuse and derision by their
        neighbours; and of the unhinging of their constitution, which God
        himself had fixed, when he brought them out of Egypt, ver. 4-13. (3.)
        Further supplications, that God would consider and pity his vineyard,
        their church and nation; assist their king, his vine-dresser; and
        convert them to, and quicken them in, his service, ver.
        14-19.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me be affected with the
        distresses of God's church. Let me pant for the fullest manifestations
        of his glory, and the blessings of his presence. Let me insist that
        his Spirit may glorify Jesus Christ, the Man of his right hand, in
        taking what is his, and showing it unto me.

      Sing loud to God our strength; with joy
      to Jacob's God do sing.
      Take up a psalm, the pleasant harp,
      timbrel and psalt'ry bring.

      Blow trumpets at new-moon, what day
      our feast appointed is:
      For charge to Isr'el, and a law
      of Jacob's God was this.

      To Joseph this a test'mony
      he made, when Egypt land
      He travelled through, where speech I heard
      I did not understand.

      His shoulder I from burdens took,
      his hands from pots did free.
      Thou didst in trouble on me call,
      and I delivered thee:

      In secret place of thundering
      I did thee answer make;
      And at the streams of Meribah
      of thee a proof did take.

      O thou, my people, give an ear,
      I'll testify to thee;
      To thee, O Isr'el, if thou wilt
      but hearken unto me.

      In midst of thee there shall not be
      any strange god at all;
      Nor unto any god unknown
      thou bowing down shalt fall.

      I am the LORD thy God, which did
      from Egypt land thee guide;
      I'll fill thy mouth abundantly,
      do thou it open wide.

      But yet my people to my voice
      would not attentive be;
      And ev'n my chosen Israel
      he would have none of me.

      So to the lust of their own hearts
      I them deliverèd;
      And then in counsels of their own
      they vainly wanderèd.

      O that my people had me heard,
      Isr'el my ways had chose!
      I had their en'mies soon subdued,
      my hand turned on their foes.

      The haters of the LORD to him
      submission should have feigned;
      But as for them, their time should have
      for evermore remained.

      He should have also fed them with
      the finest of the wheat;
      Of honey from the rock thy fill
      I should have made thee eat.

        This psalm was probably composed for the Feast of Trumpets, on the

        he hath done for them, ver. 1-7. (2.) Instructions concerning God's
        new-covenant grant of himself and his benefits to men; their
        ungrateful refusal thereof; and the misery they incur, and happiness
        they lose thereby, ver. 8-16.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let my soul
        consider what God is to, hath done for, and given to men - to me: and
        let all my inward powers steadfastly believe his declarations, and

        enemies, and glorify himself in the world, ver.
        9-18.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me be affected with the inward
        combinations of my own lusts with Satan and the world, and with the
        joint endeavours of open enemies and naughty professors against the
        church and interests of Christ; and commit the cause to God who
        judgeth righteously.

      How lovely is thy dwelling-place,
      O LORD of hosts, to me!
      The tabernacles of thy grace
      how pleasant, LORD, they be!

      My thirsty soul longs veh'mently,
      yea faints, thy courts to see:
      My very heart and flesh cry out,
      O living God, for thee.

      Behold, the sparrow findeth out
      an house wherein to rest;
      The swallow also for herself
      hath purchasèd a nest;

      Ev'n thine own altars, where she safe
      her young ones forth may bring,
      O thou almighty LORD of hosts,
      who art my God and King.

      Bless'd are they in thy house that dwell,
      they ever give thee praise.
      Bless'd is the man whose strength thou art,
      in whose heart are thy ways:

      Who passing thorough Baca's vale,
      therein do dig up wells;
      Also the rain that falleth down
      the pools with water fills.

      So they from strength unwearied go
      still forward unto strength,
      Until in Zion they appear
      before the Lord at length.

      LORD God of hosts, my prayèr hear;
      O Jacob's God, give ear.
      See God our shield, look on the face
      of thine anointed dear.

      For in thy courts one day excels
      a thousand; rather in
      My God's house will I keep a door,
      than dwell in tents of sin.

      For God the LORD's a sun and shield:
      he'll grace and glory give;
      And will withhold no good from them
      that uprightly do live.

      O thou that art the LORD of hosts,
      that man is truly blessed,
      Who by assured confidence
      on thee alone doth rest.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm is much like the 27th, 42nd, 43rd, and 63rd, and may have
        been composed on the same occasion with the former, when David was
        banished from Jerusalem by Absalom his son, 2 Sam. 15-16. We have
        here, (1.) David's ardent affection towards the public ordinances of
        God, and sense of their happiness who enjoyed them, ver. 1-7, 10. (2.)
        His heart-burning desire to the God of ordinances, ver. 8-9. (3.) His
        assured faith of God's kindness, and persuasion of the happiness of
        such as trust in him, ver. 11-12.<br/><br/><br/>So let my heart cry
        out for God, the living God. So let me covet earnestly intimate
        fellowship with him in his ordinances. So let me praise his name, and
        hold on in his way, till I arrive at the Zion above. So let God be my
        friend, my protector, my supplier, my store, and the everlasting rock
        of my rest.

      O LORD, thou hast been fav'rable
      to thy belovèd land:
      Jacob's captivity thou hast
      recalled with mighty hand.

      Thou pardonèd thy people hast
      all their iniquities;
      Thou all their trespasses and sins
      hast covered from thine eyes.

      Thou took'st off all thine ire, and turn'dst
      from thy wrath's furiousness.
      Turn us, God of our health, and cause
      thy wrath 'gainst us to cease.

      Shall thy displeasure thus endure
      against us without end?
      Wilt thou to generations all
      thine anger forth extend?

      That in thee may thy people joy,
      wilt thou not us revive?
      Show us thy mercy, LORD, to us
      do thy salvation give.

      I'll hear what God the LORD will speak:
      to his folk he'll speak peace,
      And to his saints; but let them not
      return to foolishness.

      To them that fear him surely near
      is his salvätion;
      That glory in our land may have
      her habitätion.

      Truth met with mercy, righteousness
      and peace kissed mutually:
      Truth springs from earth, and righteousness
      looks down from heaven high.

      Yea, what is good the LORD shall give;
      our land shall yield increase:
      Justice, to set us in his steps,
      shall go before his face.

    commentary:

        This psalm relates to some remarkable deliverance of the Jewish
        nation; but whether that effected by the advancement of David to the
        throne, or that from the Assyrian invasion, 2 Kings 19, or from the
        Chaldean captivity, Ezra 1, is uncertain. It contains, (1.) Thankful
        acknowledgments of divine favours received, ver. 1-3. (2.)
        Supplications that further favours and deliverances may be speedily
        bestowed, ver. 4-7. (3.) Firm expectations of a gracious answer, in
        the coming, mediation, and blessings, of the Messiah, ver.
        8-13.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let my soul be affected with the
        mercies, which I, which my country, which the church of God, have
        enjoyed. Let me be thereby encouraged to plead for more. And let me,
        without doubting, credit the promises, and expect supply from the
        fulness of Christ.

      O LORD, do thou bow down thine ear,
      and hear me graciously;
      Because I sore afflicted am,
      and am in poverty.

      Because I'm holy, let my soul
      by thee preservèd be:
      O thou my God, thy servant save,
      that puts his trust in thee.

      Sith unto thee I daily cry,
      be merciful to me.
      Rejoice thy servant's soul; for, Lord,
      I lift my soul to thee.

      For thou art gräcious, O Lord,
      and ready to forgive;
      And rich in mercy, all that call
      upon thee to relieve.

      Hear, LORD, my pray'r; unto the voice
      of my request attend:
      In troublous times I'll call on thee;
      for thou wilt answer send.

      Lord, there is none among the gods
      that may with thee compare;
      And like the works which thou hast done,
      not any work is there.

      All nations whom thou mad'st shall come

      Which are to be admired; and thou
      art God thyself alone.

      Teach me thy way, and in thy truth,
      O Lord, then walk will I;
      Unite my heart, that I thy name
      may fear continually.

      O Lord my God, with all my heart
      to thee I will give praise;
      And I the glory will ascribe
      unto thy name always:

      Because thy mercy toward me
      in greatness doth excel;
      And thou delivered hast my soul
      out from the lowest hell.

      O God, the proud against me rise,
      and vi'lent men have met,
      That for my soul have sought; and thee
      before them have not set.

      But thou art full of pity, Lord,
      a God most gräcious,
      Long-suffering, and in thy truth
      and mercy plentèous.

      O turn to me thy countenance,
      and mercy on me have;
      Thy servant strengthen, and the son
      of thine own handmaid save.

      Show me a sign for good, that they
      which do me hate may see,
      And be ashamed; because thou, LORD,
      didst help and comfort me.

    commentary:

        This psalm contains, (1.) David's fervent supplications, that God
        would hear his prayers, ver. 1, 6-7; mercifully preserve and save him,
        ver. 2-3, 16; and afford him joy, strength, and honour, ver. 4, 11,
        17. (2.) His pleas, wherewith he enforceth his prayers, drawn from the
        goodness of God, ver. 5, 13, 15; his own relations to, and trust in
        God, ver. 2, 4, 16; his former experience of God's kindness, ver 17;
        and from the malice of his enemies, ver. 14. (3.) His ascription of
        praise to God, as matchless in his nature and work; as the sole object
        of worship; and as great and infinitely gracious, ver. 8-10,
        12-13.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me remember, that the psalmist
        hath left me an example, that I should walk in his steps.

        This psalm is an encomium upon mount Zion, as typical of the gospel
        church. (1.) For the sake of the temple, mount Zion is preferred to
        every other place in Canaan; as more honoured by God and more
        delighted in by him, ver. 1-3. (2.) In respect of better inhabitants,
        greater stability, and more important joys and blessings, the church
        is preferred to all other nations, ver. 4-7.<br/><br/><br/>While I
        sing, let me observe the dignity of relation to Jehovah as my God. Let
        me praise him for founding his church on Jesus the unmoveable Rock of

        rejoice in the glorious promises made concerning her, and supplicate

      LORD God, my Saviour, day and night
      before thee cried have I.
      Before thee let my prayèr come;
      give ear unto my cry.

      For troubles great do fill my soul;
      my life draws nigh the grave.
      I'm counted with those that go down
      to pit, and no strength have.

      Ev'n free among the dead, like them
      that slain in grave do lie;
      Cut off from thy hand, whom no more
      thou hast in memory.

      Thou hast me laid in lowest pit,
      in deeps and darksome caves.
      Thy wrath lies hard on me, thou hast
      me pressed with all thy waves.

      Thou hast put far from me my friends,
      thou mad'st them to abhor me;
      And I am so shut up, that I
      find no evasion for me.

      By reason of afflïction
      mine eye mourns dolefully:
      To thee, LORD, do I call, and stretch
      my hands continually.

      Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?
      shall they rise, and thee bless?
      Shall in the grave thy love be told?
      in death thy faithfulness?

      Shall thy great wonders in the dark,
      or shall thy righteousness
      Be known to any in the land
      of deep forgetfulness?

      But, LORD, to thee I cried; my pray'r
      at morn prevent shall thee.
      Why, LORD, dost thou cast off my soul,
      and hid'st thy face from me?

      Distressed am I, and from my youth
      I ready am to die;
      Thy terrors I have borne, and am
      distracted fearfully.

      The dreadful fierceness of thy wrath
      quite over me doth go:
      Thy terrors great have cut me off,
      they did pursue me so.

      For round about me ev'ry day,
      like water, they did roll;
      And, gathering together, they
      have compassèd my soul.

      My friends thou hast put far from me,
      and him that did me love;
      And those that mine acquaintance were
      to darkness didst remove.

    commentary:

        In this doleful psalm, after a very short declaration of his faith, we
        have, (1.) Heman's bitter wailing over his distressed case, that his
        troubles were great; his body at the point of death; his soul filled
        with grief; his God hiding and angry; his mind distressed with
        terrors; and his friends unkind, ver. 3-9, 14-18. (2.) His bitter
        groans to, and expostulations with God, importing, that he had long
        cried for mercy, and that in death nothing could be done for him,
        etc., ver. 1-2, 9-14.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me think how
        dreadful hell must be, when even fatherly chastisements are so severe;
        how dreadful the enormity of sin, which provokes God so grievously to
        afflict his dearest favourites; and how necessary it is to retain our
        faith of our relation to God, amidst the worst of troubles.

      GOD's mercies I will ever sing;
      and with my mouth I shall
      Thy faithfulness make to be known

      For mercy shall be built, said I,
      for ever to endure;
      Thy faithfulness, ev'n in the heav'ns,
      thou wilt establish sure.

      I with my chosen One have made
      a cov'nant graciously;
      And to my servant, whom I loved,
      to David sworn have I;

      That I thy seed establish shall
      for ever to remain,
      And will to generations all
      thy throne build and maintain.

      The praises of thy wonders, LORD,
      the heavens shall express;

      of saints thy faithfulness.

      For who in heaven with the LORD
      may once himself compare?
      Who is like GOD among the sons

      Great fear in meeting of the saints

      Ev'n in the raging of the sea
      thou over it dost reign;
      And when the waves thereof do swell,
      thou stillest them again.

      Rahab in pieces thou didst break,
      like one that slaughtered is;
      And with thy mighty arm thou hast
      dispersed thine enemies.

      The heav'ns are thine, thou for thine own
      the earth dost also take;
      The world, and fulness of the same,
      thy pow'r did found and make.

      The north and south from thee alone
      their first beginning had;
      Both Tabor mount and Hermon hill
      shall in thy name be glad.

      Thou hast an arm that's full of power,
      thy hand is great in might;
      And thy right hand exceedingly
      exalted is in height.

      Justice and judgment of thy throne
      are made the dwelling-place;
      Mercy, accompanied with truth,
      shall go before thy face.

      O greatly blessed the people are
      the joyful sound that know;
      In brightness of thy face, O LORD,
      they ever on shall go.

      They in thy name shall all the day
      rejoice exceedingly;
      And in thy righteousness shall they
      exalted be on high.

      Because the glory of their strength
      doth only stand in thee;
      And in thy favour shall our horn
      and pow'r exalted be.

      For GOD is our defence; and he
      to us doth safety bring:
      The Holy One of Israel
      is our almighty King.

      In vision to thy Holy One
      thou saidst, I help upon
      A strong one laid; out of the folk
      I raised a chosen one;

      Ev'n David, I have found him out
      a servant unto me;
      And with my holy oil my King
      anointed him to be.

      With whom my hand shall stablished be;
      mine arm shall make him strong.
      On him the foe shall not exact,
      nor son of mischief wrong.

      I will beat down before his face
      all his malicious foes;
      I will them greatly plague who do
      with hatred him oppose.

      My mercy and my faithfulness
      with him yet still shall be;
      And in my name his horn and pow'r
      men shall exalted see.

      His hand and pow'r shall reach afar;
      I'll set it in the sea;
      And his right hand establishèd
      shall in the rivers be.

      Thou art my Father, he shall cry,
      thou art my God alone;
      And he shall say, Thou art the Rock
      of my salvätion.

      I'll make him my first-born, more high
      than kings of any land.
      My love I'll ever keep for him,
      my cov'nant fast shall stand.

      His seed I by my pow'r will make
      for ever to endure;
      And, as the days of heav'n, his throne
      shall stable be, and sure.

      But if his children shall forsake
      my laws, and go astray,
      And in my judgments shall not walk,
      but wander from my way:

      If they my laws break, and do not
      keep my commändments;
      I'll visit then their faults with rods,
      their sins with chastisements.

      Yet I'll not take my love from him,
      nor false my promise make.
      My cov'nant I'll not break, nor change
      what with my mouth I spake.

      Once by my holiness I sware,
      to David I'll not lie;
      His seed and throne shall, as the sun,
      before me last for aye.

      It, like the moon, shall ever be
      established stedfastly;
      And like to that which in the heav'n
      doth witness faithfully.

      But thou, displeasèd, hast cast off,
      thou didst abhor and loathe;
      With him that thine anointed is
      thou hast been very wroth.

      Thou hast thy servant's covenant
      made void, and quite cast by;
      Thou hast profaned his crown, while it
      cast on the ground doth lie.

      Thou all his hedges hast broke down,
      his strongholds down hast torn.
      He to all passers-by a spoil,
      to neighbours is a scorn.

      Thou hast set up his foes' right hand;
      mad'st all his en'mies glad:
      Turned his sword's edge, and him to stand
      in battle hast not made.

      His glory thou hast made to cease,
      his throne to ground down cast;
      Shortened his days of youth, and him
      with shame thou covered hast.

      How long, LORD, wilt thou hide thyself?
      for ever, in thine ire?
      And shall thine indignätion
      burn like unto a fire?

      Remember, Lord, how short a time
      I shall on earth remain:
      O wherefore is it so that thou
      hast made all men in vain?

      What man is he that liveth here,
      and death shall never see?
      Or from the powèr of the grave
      what man his soul shall free?

      Thy former loving-kindnesses,
      O Lord, where be they now?
      Those which in truth and faithfulness
      to David sworn hast thou?

      Mind, Lord, thy servant's sad reproach;
      how I in bosom bear
      The scornings of the people all,
      who strong and mighty are.

      Wherewith thy raging enemies
      reproached, O LORD, think on;
      Wherewith they have reproached the steps
      of thine anointed one.

      All blessing to the LORD our God
      let be ascribèd then:
      For evermore so let it be.

        This psalm was perhaps composed on the occasion of Absalom's
        rebellion, 2 Sam. 15; or of the revolt of the ten tribes, from their
        subjection to the family of David, 1 Kings 12; or it relates to the
        Chaldean oppression and captivity, 2 Kings 24-25. In the first, and
        joyful part, we have, (1.) The foundation of all comfort, happiness,
        honour, and stability, laid in the mercy of God, and his covenant with
        David, emblematic of that made with Jesus Christ for the redemption of
        mankind, ver. 1-4. (2.) A celebration of the God of the covenant, in
        his faithfulness, glory, greatness, mercy, and equity; and in his
        works, ver. 5-14; and of the glorious dignity, happiness, and safety
        of the covenant people, ver. 15-18. (3.) A bundle of covenant
        promises, securing proper qualifications, assistance and glory, to the

        notwithstanding their manifold sins and chastisements, ver.

        Grievous lamentations over the dishonour, distress, and danger of
        David's family, ver. 38-45. (2.) Expostulations with God concerning
        the same - drawn from the continuance of trouble; the shortness of
        human life, and certainty of death; the withdrawment of former
        kindness promised in the covenant; and the insolent reproaches of
        enemies, ver. 46-51. (3.) A triumphant conclusion of praise to God,
        ver. 52.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me chiefly keep mine eyes on
        David's Lord. Let me with joy behold the covenant made with him, for
        our redemption. Let me adore my covenant God, as in him, well pleased
        for his righteousness' sake, and rendering him and his seed most
        blessed for evermore. And as Jesus' sufferings for me purchased my
        eternal happiness, let never my own, or the church's troubles weaken
        my faith, or make me drop my songs of praise.

      Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
      in generations all.
      Before thou ever hadst brought forth
      the mountains great or small;

      Ere ever thou hadst formed the earth,
      and all the world abroad;
      Ev'n thou from everlasting art
      to everlasting God.

      Thou dost unto destrüction
      man that is mortal turn;
      And unto them thou say'st, Again,
      ye sons of men, return.

      Because a thousand years appear
      no more before thy sight
      Than yesterday, when it is past,
      or than a watch by night.

      As with an overflowing flood
      thou carriest them away:
      They like a sleep are, like the grass
      that grows at morn are they.

      At morn it flourishes and grows,
      cut down at ev'n doth fade.
      For by thine anger we're consumed,
      thy wrath makes us afraid.

      Our sins thou and iniquities
      dost in thy presence place,
      And sett'st our secret faults before
      the brightness of thy face.

      For in thine anger all our days
      do pass on to an end;
      And as a tale that hath been told,
      so we our years do spend.

      Threescore and ten years do sum up
      our days and years, we see;
      Or if, by reason of more strength,
      in some fourscore they be:

      Yet doth the strength of such old men
      but grief and labour prove;
      For it is soon cut off, and we
      fly hence, and soon remove.

      Who knows the powèr of thy wrath?
      according to thy fear
      So is thy wrath: Lord, teach thou us
      our end in mind to bear;

      And so to count our days, that we
      our hearts may still apply
      To learn thy wisdom and thy truth,
      that we may live thereby.

      Turn yet again to us, O LORD,
      how long thus shall it be?
      Let it repent thee now for those
      that servants are to thee.

      O with thy tender mercies, Lord,
      us early satisfy;
      So we rejoice shall all our days,
      and still be glad in thee.

      According as the days have been,
      wherein we grief have had,
      And years wherein we ill have seen,
      so do thou make us glad.

      O let thy work and pow'r appear
      thy servants' face before;
      And show unto their children dear
      thy glory evermore:

      And let the beauty of the LORD
      our God be us upon:
      Our handiworks establish thou,
      establish them each one.

        This psalm was composed by Moses, the man of God, some time after God
        had sentenced the Hebrews to wandering and death in the wilderness,
        Num. 14. In it, (1.) Moses comforts himself, and his people, with the
        eternal and unchangeable duration of God himself, and their interest
        in him, ver. 1-2. (2.) He humbles himself and his people with the
        consideration of human frailty, ver. 3-6. (3.) He submits himself and
        his people to the righteous sentence of God passed upon them, ver.
        7-11. (4.) By prayer he commits himself and his people to their
        gracious and merciful God; and requests the sanctified use of their
        awful chastisements; the averting of divine wrath, and the bestowal of
        true comforts and joys; the returns of his favour, and the progress of
        his work of mercy among their children, ver. 12-17.<br/><br/><br/>Let
        me sing this psalm, as but the tenant of an hour, who hath none
        assurance of his present life: Sing it as resigned to my lot on earth,
        however afflicted; as active in preparation for death; and committing
        myself and family to the God of truth as our Redeemer, our God, and
        our everlasting all.

      He that doth in the secret place
      of the most High reside,
      Under the shade of him that is
      th' Almighty shall abide.

      I of the LORD my God will say,
      He is my refuge still,
      He is my fortress, and my God,
      and in him trust I will.

      Assuredly he shall thee save,
      and give deliverance
      From subtle fowler's snare, and from
      the noisome pestilence.

      His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust
      under his wings shall be:
      His faithfulness shall be a shield
      and buckler unto thee.

      Thou shalt not need to be afraid
      for terrors of the night;
      Nor for the arrow that doth fly
      by day, while it is light;

      Nor for the pestilence, that walks
      in darkness secretly;
      Nor for destruction, that doth waste
      at noon-day openly.

      A thousand at thy side shall fall,
      on thy right hand shall lie
      Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee
      it shall not once come nigh.

      Only thou with thine eyes shalt look,
      and a beholder be;
      And thou therein the just reward
      of wicked men shalt see.

      Because the LORD, who constantly
      my refuge is alone,
      Ev'n the Most High, is made by thee
      thy habitätion;

      No plague shall near thy dwelling come;
      no ill shall thee befall:
      For thee to keep in all thy ways
      his angels charge he shall.

      They in their hands shall bear thee up,
      still waiting thee upon;
      Lest thou at any time should'st dash
      thy foot against a stone.

      Upon the adder thou shalt tread,
      and on the lion strong;
      Thy feet on dragons trample shall,
      and on the lions young.

      Because on me he set his love,
      I'll save and set him free;
      Because my great name he hath known,
      I will him set on high.

      He'll call on me, I'll answer him;
      I will be with him still
      In trouble, to deliver him,
      and honour him I will.

      With length of days unto his mind
      I will him satisfy;
      I also my salvätion
      will cause his eyes to see.

    commentary:

        This psalm was perhaps penned on the occasion of the pestilence,
        inflicted for numbering the people, 2 Sam. 24. In it, while the
        psalmist, by faith, takes God for his own refuge and keeper (ver. 2-9)
        he, for the encouragement of others to do the same, represents, (1.)
        The dignity, extent, and continuance, of their happiness and safety,
        who have God for their residence, ver. 1-4. (2.) Their preservation
        from all malice and baleful influence of the powers of darkness, while
        multitudes are ruined thereby, ver. 3-9. (3.) Their enjoyment of
        angels for their guard; and their triumph over devils and other
        opposers, ver. 10-12. (4.) Their possession of special favour from,
        and delightful intimacy with God, here and hereafter, ver.
        13-16.<br/><br/><br/>In singing these lines, let mine eyes be fixed on
        Jesus, the Man of God's right hand, in whom all these promises were
        fulfilled to the highest; and, in his name, let me depend on them to
        be accomplished in myself. And let all the begun experience I have had
        thereof, encourage me to rejoice in hope of the more abundant mercies
        and glory of God.

      To render thanks unto the LORD
      it is a comely thing,
      And to thy name, O thou Most High,
      due praise aloud to sing.

      Thy loving-kindness to show forth
      when shines the morning light;
      And to declare thy faithfulness
      with pleasure ev'ry night,

      On a ten-stringèd instrument,
      upon the psaltery,
      And on the harp with solemn sound,
      and grave sweet melody.

      For thou, LORD, by thy mighty works
      hast made my heart right glad;
      And I will triumph in the works
      which by thine hands were made.

      How great, LORD, are thy works! each thought
      of thine a deep it is:
      A brutish man it knoweth not;
      fools understand not this.

      When those that lewd and wicked are
      spring quickly up like grass,
      And workers of iniquity
      do flourish all apace;

      It is that they for ever may
      destroyèd be and slain:
      But thou, O LORD, art the Most High,
      for ever to remain.

      For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD,
      thine en'mies perish shall;
      The workers of iniquity
      shall be dispersèd all.

      But thou shalt, like unto the horn
      of th' unicorn, exalt
      My horn on high: thou with fresh oil
      anoint me also shalt.

      Mine eyes shall also my desire
      see on mine enemies;
      Mine ears shall of the wicked hear
      that do against me rise.

      But like the palm-tree flourishing
      shall be the righteous one;
      He shall like to the cedar grow
      that is in Lebanon.

      Those that within the house of GOD
      are planted by his grace,
      They shall grow up, and flourish all
      in our God's holy place.

      And in old age, when others fade,
      they fruit still forth shall bring;
      They shall be fat, and full of sap,
      and aye be flourishing;

      To show that upright is the LORD:
      he is a rock to me;
      And he from all unrighteousness
      is altogether free.

        In this psalm or song for the sabbath day,, (1.) Praise, the business
        of the sabbath, is earnestly recommended, ver. 1-3. (2.) God's works
        (which are the reason of the sabbath and ground of praise) are
        celebrated, in their greatness, and unsearchableness, ver. 4-6. (3.)
        The ruin of sinners and the felicity of saints are beautifully
        contrasted. Sinners shall perish; but God, the portion and life of
        saints, shall endure for ever. Sinners, notwithstanding their
        temporary flourish, shall be cut off and destroyed; but saints shall
        be exalted and comforted. Sinners shall be confounded and ruined; but
        saints, through their union to, and fellowship with Christ, shall
        prosper and flourish, to the manifestation of God's faithfulness and
        equity, ver. 7-15.<br/><br/><br/>While I keep the sabbath of the Lord
        my God, let these things deeply affect my heart; and be it my care, by

      Thy folk they break in pieces, LORD,

      Ye brutish people! understand;

      The Lord did plant the ear of man,

      He that the nations doth correct,
      shall he not chastise you?
      He knowledge unto man doth teach,
      and shall himself not know?

      Man's thoughts to be but vanity
      the LORD doth well discern.
      Bless'd is the man thou chast'nest, LORD,
      and mak'st thy law to learn:

      That thou may'st give him rest from days
      of sad adversity,
      Until the pit be digged for those
      that work iniquity.

      For sure the LORD will not cast off
      those that his people be,
      Neither his own inheritance
      quit and forsake will he:

      But judgment unto righteousness
      shall yet return again;
      And all shall follow after it
      that are right-hearted men.

      Who will rise up for me against
      those that do wickedly?
      Who will stand up for me 'gainst those
      that work iniquity?

      Unless the LORD had been my help
      when I was sore oppressed,
      Almost my soul had in the house
      of silence been at rest.

      When I had utterèd this word,
      (my foot doth slip away),
      Thy mercy held me up, O LORD,
      thy goodness did me stay.

      Amidst the multitude of thoughts
      which in my heart do fight,
      My soul, lest it be overcharged,
      thy comforts do delight.

      Shall of iniquity the throne
      have fellowship with thee,
      Which mischief, cunningly contrived,
      doth by a law decree?

      Against the righteous souls they join,
      they guiltless blood condemn.
      But of my refuge God's the rock,
      and my defence from them.

        This is a psalm for the afflicted people of God, in which, (1.) God's

        of God's works of creation, providence and grace, ver. 1-11. (2.) His
        gracious comforts are presented to the persecuted saints, that he will
        bless them in and by their afflictions, and give them rest after them,
        while their enemies are ruined; that God will not cast them off when
        cast down, but will, in his due time, reduce things to their right

        22-33; but relates to the calling of the Gentiles to our Redeemer.
        Here are, (1.) Solemn calls to ascribe praises and glory to our high
        and great Immanuel, ver. 1-9. (2.) Loud proclamations of Jesus'
        establishment of his gospel church, and of his coming to Judge the
        world, to the great joy of his friends, ver.
        10-13.<br/><br/><br/>While these high praises of God are in my mouth,
        let my heart behold the glory, believe the promises, and burn with
        desire after the enjoyment of Christ, and of God in him.

      GOD reigneth, let the earth be glad,
      and isles rejoice each one.
      Dark clouds him compass; and in right
      with judgment dwells his throne.

      Fire goes before him, and his foes
      it burns up round about:
      His lightnings lighten did the world;
      earth saw, and shook throughout.

      Hills at the presence of the LORD,
      like wax, did melt away;
      Ev'n at the presence of the Lord
      of all the earth, I say.

      The heav'ns declare his righteousness,
      all men his glory see.
      All who serve graven images,
      confounded let them be.

      Who do of idols boast themselves,
      let shame upon them fall:
      Ye that are callèd gods, see that
      ye do him worship all.

      Zion did hear, and joyful was,
      glad Judah's daughters were;
      They much rejoiced, O LORD, because
      thy judgments did appear.

      For thou, O LORD, art high above
      all things on earth that are;
      Above all other gods thou art
      exalted very far.

      Hate ill, all ye that love the LORD:
      his saints' souls keepeth he;
      And from the hands of wicked men
      he sets them safe and free.

      For all those that be rïghteous
      sown is a joyful light,
      And gladness sown is for all those
      that are in heart upright.

      Ye righteous, in the LORD rejoice;
      express your thankfulness,
      When ye into your memory
      do call his holiness.

        This psalm is of the same strain with the preceding; and contains,
        (1.) Solemn calls to the Gentile nations to rejoice at the equity and
        extent of Jesus' new-testament kingdom, and at the destruction of
        hardened Jews and heathen idolaters, occasioned by the establishment
        thereof, ver. 1-7. (2.) Representations of the pure and holy joy of
        the saints, on account of Jesus' highness, and the glory of God
        manifested therein, and of the care taken for their safety and
        comfort, ver. 8-12.<br/><br/><br/>Join the choir, O my soul. Sing

      O sing a new song to the LORD,
      for wonders he hath done:
      His right hand and his holy arm
      him victory hath won.

      The LORD God his salvätion
      hath causèd to be known;
      His justice in the heathen's sight
      he openly hath shown.

      He mindful of his grace and truth
      to Isr'el's house hath been;
      And the salvation of our God
      all ends of th' earth have seen.

      Let all the earth unto the LORD
      send forth a joyful noise;
      Lift up your voice aloud to him,
      sing praises, and rejoice.

      With harp, with harp, and voice of psalms,
      unto JEHOVAH sing:
      With trumpets, cornets, gladly sound
      before the LORD the King.

      Let seas and all their fulness roar;
      the world, and dwellers there;
      Let floods clap hands, and let the hills
      together joy declare

      Before the LORD; because he comes,
      to judge the earth comes he:
      He'll judge the world with righteousness,
      his folk with equity.

        This psalm insists on the same subject as the two preceding; and
        contains, (1.) Demands of praise to the Redeemer, for the wonders he
        hath wrought; the victories he hath won; the discoveries he hath made;
        and the promises he fulfils, ver. 1, 3. (2.) Demands of universal, and
        high rejoicing at the erection and establishment of his gospel church;
        and at his coming in the clouds to judge the world, ver.
        4-9.<br/><br/><br/>While my lips utter these lofty notes, let my soul,
        according to this time also, say, What hath the Lord wrought? What is
        Jesus - what is Jehovah to my heart? What hath he done for mankind,
        and what for my soul? What of Jesus - what of Jehovah, have mine eyes
        seen, and my heart tasted? And while I assuredly believe his return to
        judgment, let me with ardour look for that blessed hope, and glorious
        appearance of the great God my Saviour. Let my soul, with rapture,
        spring forth to meet his burning chariot wheels, and long to see
        creation all on flames.

      Moses and Aaron 'mong his priests,

      Within the pillar of the cloud
      he unto them did speak:
      The testimonies he them taught,
      and laws, they did not break.

      Thou answer'dst them, O LORD our God;

      Pardon to them, though on their deeds

      O LORD, unto my pray'r give ear,
      my cry let come to thee;
      And in the day of my distress
      hide not thy face from me.

      Give ear to me; what time I call,
      to answer me make haste:
      For, as an hearth, my bones are burnt,
      my days, like smoke, do waste.

      My heart within me smitten is,
      and it is witherèd
      Like very grass; so that I do
      forget to eat my bread.

      By reason of my groaning voice
      my bones cleave to my skin.
      Like pelican in wilderness
      forsaken I have been:

      I like an owl in desert am,
      that nightly there doth moan;
      I watch, and like a sparrow am
      on the house-top alone.

      My bitter en'mies all the day
      reproaches cast on me;
      And, being mad at me, with rage
      against me sworn they be.

      For why? I ashes eaten have
      like bread, in sorrows deep;
      My drink I also mingled have
      with tears that I did weep.

      Thy wrath and indignätion
      did cause this grief and pain;
      For thou hast lift me up on high,
      and cast me down again.

      My days are like unto a shade,
      which doth declining pass;
      And I am dried and witherèd,
      ev'n like unto the grass.

      But thou, LORD, everlasting art,
      and thy remembrance shall
      Continually endure, and be
      to generations all.

      Thou shalt arise, and mercy have
      upon thy Zion yet;
      The time to favour her is come,
      the time that thou hast set.

      For in her rubbish and her stones
      thy servants pleasure take;
      Yea, they the very dust thereof
      do favour for her sake.

      So shall the heathen people fear
      the LORD's most holy name;
      And all the kings on earth shall dread
      thy glory and thy fame.

      When Zion by the mighty LORD
      built up again shall be,
      In glory then and majesty
      to men appear shall he.

      The prayèr of the destitute
      he surely will regard;
      Their prayèr will he not despise,
      by him it shall be heard.

      For generations yet to come
      this shall be on record:
      So shall the people that shall be
      created praise the LORD.

      He from his sanctuary's height
      hath downward cast his eye;
      And from his glorious throne in heaven
      the LORD the earth did spy;

      That of the mournful prisoner
      the groanings he might hear,
      To set them free that unto death
      by men appointed are:

      That they in Zion may declare
      the LORD's most holy name,
      And publish in Jerusalem
      the praises of the same;

      When as the people gather shall
      in troops with one accord,
      When kingdoms shall assembled be
      to serve the highest LORD.

      My wonted strength and force he hath
      abated in the way,
      And he my days hath shortenèd:
      Thus therefore did I say,

      My God, in mid-time of my days
      take thou me not away:
      From age to age eternally
      thy years endure and stay.

      The firm foundation of the earth
      of old time thou hast laid;
      The heavens also are the work
      which thine own hands have made.

      Thou shalt for evermore endure,
      but they shall perish all;
      Yea, ev'ry one of them wax old,
      like to a garment, shall:

      Thou, as a vesture, shalt them change,
      and they shall changèd be:
      But thou the same art, and thy years
      are to eternity.

      The children of thy servants shall
      continually endure;
      And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed
      shall be established sure.

      I all day long am made a scorn,
      Reproached by my malicious foes:
      The madmen are against me sworn,

      For I have ashes eaten up,
      To me as if they had been bread;
      And with my drink I in my cup
      Of bitter tears a mixture made.

      My days are like a shade alway,
      Which doth declining swiftly pass;
      And I am witherèd away,
      Much like unto the fading grass.

      But thou, O LORD, shalt still endure,
      From change and all mutation free,
      And to all generations sure
      Shall thy remembrance ever be.

      Thou shalt arise, and mercy yet
      Thou to mount Zion shalt extend:
      Her time for favour which was set,
      Behold, is now come to an end.

      Thy saints take pleasure in her stones,
      Her very dust to them is dear.
      All heathen lands and kingly thrones
      On earth thy glorious name shall fear.

      GOD in his glory shall appear,
      When Zion he builds and repairs.
      He shall regard and lend his ear
      Unto the needy's humble pray'rs:

      Th' afflicted's pray'r he will not scorn.
      All times this shall be on record:
      And generations yet unborn
      Shall praise and magnify the LORD.

      He from his holy place looked down,
      The earth he viewed from heav'n on high;
      To hear the pris'ner's mourning groan,
      And free them that are doomed to die;

      That Zion, and Jerus'lem too,
      His name and praise may well record,
      When people and the kingdoms do
      Assemble all to praise the LORD.

      My strength he weakened in the way,
      My days of life he shortenèd.
      My God, O take me not away
      In mid-time of my days, I said:

      Thy years throughout all ages last.
      Of old thou hast establishèd
      The earth's foundation firm and fast:
      Thy mighty hands the heav'ns have made.

      They perish shall, as garments do,
      But thou shalt evermore endure;
      As vestures, thou shalt change them so;
      And they shall all be changèd sure:

      But from all changes thou art free;
      Thy endless years do last for aye.
      Thy servants, and their seed who be,
      Established shall before thee stay.

        This psalm relates to some grievous distress; wherein are observable,
        (1.) Bitter complaints of divine hidings and wrath; of sore bodily
        troubles; of inward griefs and perplexities; of calumnious reproaches;
        of sudden changes of condition, and of apparent nearness to death,
        ver. 1-11. (2.) Seasonable comforts against these grievances, arising
        from the eternity and unchangeableness of God, ver. 13, 24, 27; and
        from the deliverances, spread, and establishment he will grant to his
        church, in answer to the prayers, and for the comfort of his afflicted
        people, ver. 13-28.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, think, my soul, if I
        am exercised by my troubles; if these of the inner man bear heaviest
        on my heart; and if I am a cordial partaker with Zion in her joys and
        griefs.

      doth satisfy thy mouth;
      So that, ev'n as the eagle's age,
      renewèd is thy youth.

      GOD righteous judgment executes
      for all oppressèd ones.
      His ways to Moses, he his acts
      made known to Isr'el's sons.

      The LORD our God is merciful,
      and he is gräcious,
      Long-suffering, and slow to wrath,
      in mercy plenteous.

      He will not chide continually,
      nor keep his anger still.
      With us he dealt not as we sinned,
      nor did requite our ill.

      For as the heaven in its height
      the earth surmounteth far;
      So great to those that do him fear
      his tender mercies are:

      As far as east is distant from
      the west, so far hath he
      From us removèd, in his love,
      all our iniquity.

      Such pity as a father hath
      unto his children dear;
      Like pity shows the LORD to such
      as worship him in fear.

      For he remembers we are dust,
      and he our frame well knows.
      Frail man, his days are like the grass,
      as flow'r in field he grows:

      For over it the wind doth pass,
      and it away is gone;
      And of the place where once it was
      it shall no more be known.

      But unto them that do him fear
      GOD's mercy never ends;
      And to their children's children still
      his righteousness extends:

      To such as keep his covenant,
      and mindful are alway
      Of his most just commändments,
      that they may them obey.

      The LORD preparèd hath his throne
      in heavens firm to stand;
      And everything that being hath
      his kingdom doth command.

      O ye his angels, that excel
      in strength, bless ye the LORD;
      Ye who obey what he commands,
      and hearken to his word.

      O bless and magnify the LORD,
      ye glorious hosts of his;
      Ye ministers, that do fulfil
      whate'er his pleasure is.

      O bless the LORD, all ye his works,
      wherewith the world is stored
      In his dominions everywhere.
      My soul, bless thou the LORD.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Here, (1.) The psalmist earnestly stirs up himself to praise God, for
        favours to himself in particular; for pardon of sins, healing of
        diseases, redemption from death, ver. 1-5; and for his mercies to his
        people, in revealing his mind to them; pardoning their sins;
        sympathizing with their weakness; pitying their afflictions; and
        perpetuating his new-covenant mercy towards them and their seed, ver.
        6-18. (2.) Conscious of his own insufficiency, he requests the
        assistance of angels, and of all the works of God, to praise Him who
        is their sovereign, ver. 19-22.<br/><br/><br/>Thus, my soul, let all
        my inward powers be stirred up to praise and thank my Redeemer, for
        all that he hath done for me, and for his church on earth.

      Bless GOD, my soul.  O LORD my God,
      thou art exceeding great;
      With honour and with majesty
      thou clothèd art in state.

      With light, as with a robe, thyself
      thou coverest about;
      And, like unto a curtain, thou
      the heavens stretchest out.

      Who of his chambers doth the beams
      within the waters lay;
      Who doth the clouds his chariot make,
      on wings of wind make way.

      Who flaming fire his ministers,
      his angels spirits, doth make:
      Who earth's foundätions did lay,
      that it should never shake.

      Thou didst it cover with the deep,
      as with a garment spread:
      The waters stood above the hills,
      when thou the word but said.

      But at the voice of thy rebuke
      they fled, and would not stay;
      They at thy thunder's dreadful voice
      did haste them fast away.

      They by the mountains do ascend,
      and by the valley-ground
      Descend, unto that very place
      which thou for them didst found.

      Thou hast a bound unto them set,
      that they may not pass over,
      That they do not return again
      the face of earth to cover.

      He to the valleys sends the springs,
      which run among the hills:
      They to all beasts of field give drink,
      wild asses drink their fills.

      By them the fowls of heav'n shall have
      their habitätion,
      Which do among the branches sing
      with delectätion.

      He from his chambers watereth
      the hills, when they are dried:
      With fruit and increase of thy works
      the earth is satisfied.

      For cattle he makes grass to grow,
      he makes the herb to spring
      For th' use of man, that food to him
      he from the earth may bring;

      And wine, that to the heart of man
      doth cheerfulness impart,
      Oil that his face makes shine, and bread
      that strengtheneth his heart.

      The trees of GOD are full of sap;
      the cedars that do stand
      In Lebanon, which planted were
      by his almighty hand.

      Birds of the air upon their boughs
      do choose their nests to make;
      As for the stork, the fir-tree she
      doth for her dwelling take.

      The lofty mountains for wild goats
      a place of refuge be;
      The conies also to the rocks
      do for their safety flee.

      He sets the moon in heav'n, thereby
      the seasons to discern:
      From him the sun his certain time
      of going down doth learn.

      Thou darkness mak'st, 'tis night, then beasts
      of forests creep abroad.
      The lions young roar for their prey,
      and seek their meat from God.

      The sun doth rise, and home they flock,
      down in their dens they lie.
      Man goes to work, his labour he
      doth to the evening ply.

      How manifold, LORD, are thy works!
      in wisdom wonderful
      Thou ev'ry one of them hast made;
      earth's of thy riches full:

      So is this great and spacious sea,
      wherein things creeping are,
      Which numbered cannot be; and beasts
      both great and small are there.

      There ships go; there thou mak'st to play
      that leviàthan great.
      These all wait on thee, that thou may'st
      in due time give them meat.

      That which thou givest unto them
      they gather for their food;
      Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
      they fillèd are with good.

      Thou hid'st thy face; they troubled are,
      their breath thou tak'st away;
      Then do they die, and to their dust
      return again do they.

      Thy quick'ning spirit thou send'st forth,
      then they created be;
      And then the earth's decayèd face
      renewèd is by thee.

      The glory of the mighty LORD
      continue shall for ever:
      The Lord JEHOVAH shall rejoice
      in all his works together.

      Earth, as affrighted, trembleth all,
      if he on it but look;
      And if the mountains he but touch,
      they presently do smoke.

      I will sing to the LORD most high,
      so long as I shall live;
      And while I being have I shall
      to my God praises give.

      Of him my meditation shall
      sweet thoughts to me afford;
      And as for me, I will rejoice
      in God, my only Lord.

      From earth let sinners be consumed,
      let ill men no more be.
      O thou my soul, bless thou the LORD.
      Praise to the LORD give ye.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was perhaps composed along with the preceding one; and
        contains, (1.) High celebrations of God, as the God of nature;
        particularly of his appearances in his heavenly palaces, ver. 1-4; of
        his creation of the sea and dry land, ver 5-9; of the provision he
        makes for his creatures, according to their respective needs, ver.
        10-28; and of his sovereign dominion and influence over them, ver.
        29-32. (2.) Holy resolutions to meditate on, and praise the Lord, in
        the view of his destruction of the wicked, ver.
        33-35.<br/><br/><br/>Lo! how the stretched heavens, how refulgent
        luminaries, how fertile fields, how towering woods, how roaring seas,
        how ranging brutes, how labouring men, how flaming seraphs, unite
        their force to awaken my soul, to tune my heart to the high praises of
        her Redeemer! Let me meet my God, my Christ, in every view. In every
        sound let me hear his voice. In every form let me discern how great is
        his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Nor let creation's lower
        plains detain my heart: Let new-covenant relations to my unbounded
        All, let redemption through his blood, fix all my thoughts, enrapture
        all my inward powers; that I may sing anthems, all on fire, to Him who
        loved me, and gave himself for me.

      Give thanks to GOD, call on his name;
      to men his deeds make known.
      Sing ye to him, sing psalms; proclaim
      his wondrous works each one.

      See that ye in his holy name
      to glory do accord;
      And let the heart of everyone
      rejoice that seeks the LORD.

      The LORD Almighty, and his strength,
      with stedfast hearts seek ye:
      His blessèd and his gracious face
      seek ye continually.

      Think on the works that he hath done,
      which admiration breed;
      His wonders, and the judgments all
      which from his mouth proceed;

      O ye that are of Abr'ham's race,
      his servant well approv'n;
      And ye that Jacob's children are,
      whom he chose for his own.

      Because he, and he only, is
      the mighty LORD our God;
      And his most righteous judgments are
      in all the earth abroad.

      His cov'nant he remembered hath,
      that it may ever stand:
      To thousand generätions
      the word he did command.

      Which covènant he firmly made
      with faithful Abraham,
      And unto Isaac, by his oath,
      he did renew the same:

      And unto Jacob, for a law,
      he made it firm and sure,
      A covènant to Israèl,
      which ever should endure.

      He said, I'll give Canàan's land
      for heritage to you;
      While they were strangers there, and few,
      in number very few:

      While yet they went from land to land
      without a sure abode;
      And while through sundry kingdoms they
      did wander far abroad;

      Yet, notwithstanding, suffered he
      no man to do them wrong:
      Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove
      kings, who were great and strong.

      Thus did he say, Touch ye not those
      that mine anointed be,
      Nor do the prophets any harm
      that do pertain to me.

      He called for famine on the land,
      he brake the staff of bread:
      But yet he sent a man before,
      by whom they should be fed;

      Ev'n Joseph, whom unnaturally
      sell for a slave did they;
      Whose feet with fetters they did hurt,
      and he in irons lay;

      Until the time that his word came
      to give him liberty;
      The word and purpose of the LORD
      did him in prison try.

      Then sent the king, and did command
      that he enlarged should be:
      He that the people's ruler was
      did send to set him free.

      A lord to rule his family
      he raised him, as most fit;
      To him of all that he possessed
      he did the charge commit:

      That he might at his pleasure bind
      the princes of the land;
      And he might teach his senators
      wisdom to understand.

      The people then of Israèl
      down into Egypt came;
      And Jacob also sojournèd
      within the land of Ham.

      And he did greatly by his power
      increase his people there;
      And stronger than their enemies
      they by his blessing were.

      Their heart he turnèd to envy
      his folk maliciously,
      With those that his own servants were
      to deal in subtlety.

      His servant Moses he did send,
      Aaron his chosen one.
      By these his signs and wonders great
      in Ham's land were made known.

      Darkness he sent, and made it dark;
      his word they did obey.
      He turned their waters into blood,
      and he their fish did slay.

      The land in plenty brought forth frogs
      in chambers of their kings.
      His word all sorts of flies and lice
      in all their borders brings.

      He hail for rain, and flaming fire
      into their land he sent:
      And he their vines and fig-trees smote;
      trees of their coasts he rent.

      He spake, and caterpillars came,
      locusts did much abound;
      Which in their land all herbs consumed,
      and all fruits of their ground.

      He smote all first-born in their land,
      chief of their strength each one.
      With gold and silver brought them forth,
      weak in their tribes were none.

      Egypt was glad when forth they went,
      their fear on them did light.
      He spread a cloud for covering,
      and fire to shine by night.

      They asked, and he brought quails: with bread
      of  heav'n  he fillèd them.
      He opened rocks, floods gushed, and ran
      in deserts like a stream.

      For on his holy promise he,
      and servant Abr'ham, thought.
      With joy his people, his elect
      with gladness, forth he brought.

      And unto them the pleasant lands
      he of the heathen gave;
      That of the people's labour they
      inheritance might have.

      That they his statutes might observe
      according to his word;
      And that they might his laws obey.
      Give praise unto the LORD.

        This psalm was a part of the solemn hymn sung at the translation of

        us, ver. 1-7. (2.) A narrative of the particular mercies of God to
        Israel for the space of 480 years, as grounds of praise: Particularly,
        his covenant with their patriarchs, ver. 8-11; his care of them, while
        strangers and sojourners, ver. 12-15; his advancement of Joseph, to be

      Give praise and thanks unto the LORD,
      for bountiful is he;
      His tender mercy doth endure
      unto eternity.

      GOD's mighty works who can express?
      or show forth all his praise?
      Blessèd are they that judgment keep,
      and justly do always.

      Remember me, LORD, with that love
      which thou to thine dost bear;
      With thy salvation, O my God,
      to visit me draw near:

      That I thy chosen's good may see,
      and in their joy rejoice;
      And may with thine inheritance
      triumph with cheerful voice.

      We with our fathers sinnèd have,
      and of iniquity
      Too long we have the workers been;
      we have done wickedly.

      The wonders great, which thou, O Lord,
      didst work in Egypt land,
      Our fathers, though they saw, yet them
      they did not understand:

      And they thy mercies' multitude
      kept not in memory;
      But at the sea, ev'n the Red Sea,
      provoked him grievously.

      Nevertheless he savèd them,
      ev'n for his own name's sake;
      That so he might to be well known
      his mighty powèr make.

      When he the Red Sea did rebuke,
      then drièd up it was:
      Through depths, as through the wilderness,
      he safely made them pass.

      From hands of those that hated them
      he did his people save;
      And from the en'my's cruel hand
      to them redemption gave.

      The waters overwhelmed their foes;
      not one was left alive.
      Then they believed his word, and praise
      to him in songs did give.

      But soon did they his mighty works
      forget unthankfully,
      And on his counsel and his will
      did not wait patiently;

      But much did lust in wilderness,
      and God in desert tempt.
      He gave them what they sought, but to
      their soul he leanness sent.

      And against Moses in the camp
      their envy did appear;
      At Aaron they, the saint of GOD,
      envìous also were.

      Therefore the earth did open wide,
      and Dathan did devour,
      And all Abiram's company
      did cover in that hour.

      Likewise among their company
      a fire was kindled then;
      And so the hot consuming flame
      burnt up these wicked men.

      Upon the hill of Horeb they
      an idol-calf did frame,
      A molten image they did make,
      and worshippèd the same.

      And thus their glory, and their God,
      most vainly changèd they
      Into the likeness of an ox
      that eateth grass or hay.

      They did forget the mighty God,
      that had their saviour been,
      By whom such great things brought to pass
      they had in Egypt seen.

      In Ham's land he did wondrous works,
      things terrible did he,
      When he his mighty hand and arm
      stretched out at the Red Sea.

      Then said he, He would them destroy,
      had not, his wrath to stay,
      His chosen Moses stood in breach,
      that them he should not slay.

      Yea, they despised the pleasant land,
      believèd not his word:
      But in their tents they murmurèd,
      not heark'ning to the LORD.

      Therefore in desert them to slay
      he lifted up his hand:
      'Mong nations to o'erthrow their seed,
      and scatter in each land.

      They unto Bàal-pèor did
      themselves associate;
      The sacrifices of the dead
      they did profanely eat.

      Thus, by their lewd invëntions,
      they did provoke his ire;
      And then upon them suddenly
      the plague brake in as fire.

      Then Phin'has rose, and justice did,
      and so the plague did cease;
      That to all ages counted was
      to him for righteousness.

      And at the waters, where they strove,
      they did him angry make,
      In such sort, that it farèd ill
      with Moses for their sake:

      Because they there his spirit meek
      provokèd bitterly,
      So that he uttered with his lips
      words unadvisedly.

      Nor, as the LORD commanded them,
      did they the nations slay:
      But with the heathen mingled were,
      and learned of them their way.

      And they their idols served, which did
      a snare unto them turn.
      Their sons and daughters they to devils
      in sacrifice did burn.

      In their own children's guiltless blood
      their hands they did imbrue,
      Whom to Canàan's idols they
      for sacrifices slew:

      So was the land defiled with blood.
      They stained with their own way,
      And with their own invëntions
      a whoring they did stray.

      Against his people kindled was
      the wrath of GOD therefore,
      Insomuch that he did his own
      inheritance abhor.

      He gave them to the heathen's hand;
      their foes did them command.
      Their en'mies them oppressed, they were
      made subject to their hand.

      He many times delivered them;
      but with their counsel so
      They him provoked, that for their sin
      they were brought very low.

      Yet their affliction he beheld,
      when he did hear their cry:
      And he for them his covenant
      did call to memory;

      After his mercies' multitude
      he did repent: And made
      Them to be pitied of all those
      who did them captive lead.

      O LORD our God, us save, and gather
      the heathen from among,
      That we thy holy name may praise
      in a triumphant song.

      Blessed be JEHOVAH, Isr'el's God,
      to all eternity:
      Let all the people say, Amen.
      Praise to the LORD give ye.

        alarming confession or narrative of Israel's wickedness against their
        God, notwithstanding his marvellous kindness to them; in provoking him
        at the Red Sea, ver 6-12; in lusting after sensual gratifications, ver
        13-15; in mutinying against his vicegerents, ver. 16-18; in
        worshipping the golden calf, ver. 19-23; in murmuring contempt of the
        promised land, ver. 24-27; in joining with the Moabites and
        Midianites, in the worship of Baal-peor, ver. 28-31; in quarrelling
        with Moses at Kadesh, ver. 32-33; in incorporating themselves with the
        Canaanites, and imitating their idolatrous and cruel customs, ver.
        34-39. (3.) An affecting view of God's great compassion to Israel,
        notwithstanding they had provoked him to inflict sore and almost
        destructive punishments upon them, ver. 40-46. (4.) An affectionate
        improvement of his kindness, in imploring his powerful deliverance,
        and ascription of endless praises to his name, ver.
        47-48.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let my soul be deeply affected with
        the dreadful nature of sin, and with men's obstinacy, nay mine own
        obstinacy therein. Let me, with amazement, behold the unbounded mercy
        of God to men; in that where sin hath abounded grace doth much more
        abound.

      Praise GOD, for he is good: for still
      his mercies lasting be.
      Let GOD's redeemed say so, whom he
      from th' en'my's hand did free;

      And gathered them out of the lands,
      from north, south, east, and west.
      They strayed in desert's pathless way,
      no city found to rest.

      For thirst and hunger in them faints
      their soul. When straits them press,
      They cry unto the LORD, and he
      them frees from their distress.

      Them also in a way to walk
      that right is he did guide,
      That they might to a city go,
      wherein they might abide.

      O that men to the LORD would give
      praise for his goodness then,
      And for his works of wonder done
      unto the sons of men!

      For he the soul that longing is
      doth fully satisfy;
      With goodness he the hungry soul
      doth fill abundantly.

      Such as shut up in darkness deep,
      and in death's shade abide,
      Whom strongly hath affliction bound,
      and irons fast have tied:

      Because against the words of God
      they wrought rebelliously,
      And they the counsel did contemn
      of him that is Most High:

      Their heart he did bring down with grief,
      they fell, no help could have.
      In trouble then they cried to GOD,
      he them from straits did save.

      He out of darkness did them bring,
      and from death's shade them take;
      These bands, wherewith they had been bound,
      asunder quite he brake.

      O that men to the LORD would give
      praise for his goodness then,
      And for his works of wonder done
      unto the sons of men!

      Because the mighty gates of brass
      in pieces he did tear,
      By him in sunder also cut
      the bars of iron were.

      Fools, for their sin, and their offence,
      do sore affliction bear;
      All kind of meat their soul abhors;
      they to death's gates draw near.

      In grief they cry to GOD; he saves
      them from their miseries.
      He sends his word, them heals, and them
      from their destruction frees.

      O that men to the LORD would give
      praise for his goodness then,
      And for his works of wonder done
      unto the sons of men!

      And let them sacrifice to him
      off'rings of thankfulness;
      And let them show abroad his works
      in songs of joyfulness.

      Who go to sea in ships, and in
      great waters trading be,
      Within the deep these men GOD's works
      and his great wonders see.

      For he commands, and forth in haste
      the stormy tempest flies,
      Which makes the sea with rolling waves
      aloft to swell and rise.

      They mount to heav'n, then to the depths
      they do go down again;
      Their soul doth faint and melt away
      with trouble and with pain.

      They reel and stagger like one drunk,
      at their wit's end they be:
      Then they to GOD in trouble cry,
      who them from straits doth free.

      The storm is changed into a calm
      at his command and will;
      So that the waves, which raged before,
      now quiet are and still.

      Then are they glad, because at rest
      and quiet now they be:
      So to the haven he them brings,
      which they desired to see.

      O that men to the LORD would give
      praise for his goodness then,
      And for his works of wonder done
      unto the sons of men!

      Among the people gatherèd
      let them exalt his name;
      Among assembled elders spread
      his most renownèd fame.

      He to dry land turns water-springs,
      and floods to wilderness;
      For sins of those that dwell therein,
      fat land to barrenness.

      The burnt and parchèd wilderness
      to water-pools he brings;
      The ground that was dried up before
      he turns to water-springs:

      And there, for dwelling, he a place
      doth to the hungry give,
      That they a city may prepare
      commodiously to live.

      There sow they fields, and vineyards plant,
      to yield fruits of increase.
      His blessing makes them multiply,
      lets not their beasts decrease.

      Again they are diminishèd,
      and very low brought down,
      Through sorrow and afflïction,
      and great opprëssion.

      He upon princes pours contempt,
      and causeth them to stray,
      And wander in a wilderness,
      wherein there is no way.

      Yet setteth he the poor on high
      from all his miseries,
      And he, much like unto a flock,
      doth make him families.

      They that are righteous shall rejoice,
      when they the same shall see;
      And, as ashamèd, stop her mouth
      shall all iniquity.

      Whoso is wise, and will these things
      observe, and them record,
      Ev'n they shall understand the love
      and kindness of the LORD.

        This psalm may be considered as an appendix to the two foregoing.
        Those represented the providence of God towards his chosen Israelites,
        who prefigured his gospel church: this, (1.) represents the
        providences of God to the children of men in general, and calls them
        to praise him for his kindness and mercy therein: particularly, 1. In
        directing and gathering travellers, whom he had justly dispersed, ver.
        1-7. 2. In delivering prisoners, whom he had justly confined, ver.
        8-14. 3. In healing the sick, whom he had justly plagued, ver. 15-22.
        4. In relieving mariners, whom he had justly bestormed, ver. 23-30. 5.
        In changing the condition of territories, persons, and families, at
        his pleasure, to the comfort of his people, and the restraining of
        wickedness, ver. 7-42. (2.) It encourageth me to a careful observation
        of God's providences, ver. 43.<br/><br/><br/>Let me sing this, with a
        heart deeply affected with the various providences of God towards
        myself and others, while we have walked by the way; been confined in
        prisons, or lain on beds of languishing; traversed the surface of the
        depths, or laboured in our respective employments. Let me be a careful
        observer of providences, and compare them with the oracles of God,
        with my behaviour, and my prayers, and also with one another: so shall
        I understand the loving kindness of the Lord.

      My heart is fixed, Lord; I will sing,
      and with my glory praise.
      Awake up psaltery and harp;
      myself I'll early raise.

      I'll praise thee 'mong the people, LORD;
      'mong nations sing will I:
      For above heav'n thy mercy's great,
      thy truth doth reach the sky.

      That those who thy belovèd are

      O do thou save with thy right hand,
      and answer give to me.

      God in his holiness hath said,
      Herein I will take pleasure;
      Shechem I will divide, and forth
      will Succoth's valley measure.

      Gilead I claim as mine by right;

      Ephraim is of my head the strength;

      Over the land of Palestine
      I will in triumph go.

      O who is he will bring me to
      the city fortified?
      O who is he that to the land
      of Edom will me guide?

      O God, thou who hadst cast us off,
      this thing wilt thou not do?
      And wilt not thou, ev'n thou, O God,
      forth with our armies go?

      Do thou from trouble give us help,

        The first five verses of this psalm are taken from Psalm 57:7-12; and
        contain praises and thanksgivings to God. The other eight are taken
        from Psalm 60:5-12; and contain prayers for, and hopes of promised

      O thou the God of all my praise,
      do thou not hold thy peace;
      For mouths of wicked men to speak
      against me do not cease:

      The mouths of vile deceitful men
      against me opened be;
      And with a false and lying tongue
      they have accusèd me.

      They did beset me round about
      with words of hateful spite;
      And though to them no cause I gave,
      against me they did fight.

      They for my love became my foes,
      but I me set to pray.
      Evil for good, hatred for love,
      to me they did repay.

      Set thou the wicked over him;
      and upon his right hand
      Give thou his greatest enemy,
      ev'n Satan, leave to stand.

      And when by thee he shall be judged,
      let him condemnèd be;
      And let his pray'r be turned to sin,
      when he shall call on thee.

      Few be his days, and in his room
      his charge another take.
      His children let be fatherless,
      his wife a widow make.

      His children let be vagabonds,
      and beg continually;
      And from their places desolate
      seek bread for their supply.

      Let covetous extortioners
      catch all he hath away:
      Of all for which he laboured hath
      let strangers make a prey.

      Let there be none to pity him,
      let there be none at all
      That on his children fatherless
      will let his mercy fall.

      Let his posterity from earth
      cut off for ever be,
      And in the foll'wing age their name
      be blotted out by thee.

      Let GOD his father's wickedness
      still to remembrance call;
      And never let his mother's sin
      be blotted out at all.

      But let them all before the LORD
      appear continually,
      That he may wholly from the earth
      cut off their memory.

      Because he mercy minded not,
      but persecuted still
      The poor and needy, that he might
      the broken-hearted kill.

      As he in cursing pleasure took,
      so let it to him fall;
      As he delighted not to bless,
      so bless him not at all.

      As cursing he like clothes put on,
      into his bowels so,
      Like water, and into his bones,
      like oil, down let it go.

      Like to the garment let it be
      which doth himself array,
      And for a girdle, wherewith he
      is girt about alway.

      From GOD let this be their reward
      that en'mies are to me,
      And their reward that speak against
      my soul maliciously.

      But do thou, for thine own name's sake,
      O GOD the Lord, for me:
      Sith good and sweet thy mercy is,
      from trouble set me free.

      For I am poor and indigent,
      afflicted sore am I,
      My heart within me also is
      wounded exceedingly.

      I pass like a declining shade,
      am like the locust tossed:
      My knees through fasting weakened are,
      my flesh hath fatness lost.

      I also am a vile reproach
      unto them made to be;
      And they that did upon me look
      did shake their heads at me.

      O do thou help and succour me,
      who art my God and LORD:
      And, for thy tender mercy's sake,
      safety to me afford:

      That thereby they may know that this
      is thy almighty hand;
      And that thou, LORD, hast done the same,
      they may well understand.

      Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord,
      bless thou with loving voice:
      Let them ashamed be when they rise;
      thy servant let rejoice.

      Let thou mine adversaries all
      with shame be clothèd over;
      And let their own confüsion
      them, as a mantle, cover.

      But as for me, I with my mouth
      will greatly praise the LORD;
      And I among the multitude
      his praises will record.

      For he shall stand at his right hand
      who is in poverty,
      To save him from all those that would
      condemn his soul to die.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Probably David penned this psalm with a view to Doeg or Ahithophel,
        and hence it is much like the 41st, 52nd, 55th, 124th, and 140th. But
        the Holy Ghost herein hath a mediate respect to Jesus, and to Judas
        the traitor, Acts 1:20. Observe, (1.) The psalmist's bitter complaints
        of his enemies, as spiteful, deceitful, false, restless, unjust,
        ungrateful, ver. 1-5. (2.) His fearful denunciations of divine
        vengeance against his distinguished foe; that he should be delivered
        into the hand of Satan; should have his prayers rejected, his life
        shortened, his substance wasted, and his posterity rendered miserable,
        ver. 6-20. (3.) His lamentation over his inward trouble, his
        approaching death, his instability of condition, pining sickness,
        reproach of enemies; and his prayers for mercy to himself, confusion
        to his enemies, and glory to his God, ver. 21-29. (4.) His triumph in
        God, as his supporter and deliverer amidst all his troubles, ver.
        30-31.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me be affected with the
        sufferings of my Redeemer, and with the misery of these Jews and
        others, who abandon themselves to be his obstinate opposers. Let me
        implore, and by faith foresee the complete ruin of all my spiritual
        enemies; and the full redemption of my soul, and of the whole mystical
        body of Christ, notwithstanding all our sinful poverty and plagues.

      To ages all; with honour shall
      his horn be raisèd high.

      The wicked shall it see, and fret,
      his teeth gnash, melt away:
      What wicked men do most desire
      shall utterly decay.

        This psalm is also alphabetically composed; and contains, (1.)
        Invitations to praise God, ver. 1. (2.) A delineation of the saints'
        character and blessedness: that they are well principled, honest,
        sincere, and kind; and shall be blessed with prosperity, outward and
        inward, with comfort amidst griefs, wisdom amidst perplexity, and with
        honour and stability; and shall have their posterity blessed after
        them, ver. 2-9. (3.) The misery of the wicked, ver.
        10.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing this, let me try my character, and
        rejoice in hope of being blessed in Christ Jesus, with all spiritual,
        temporal, and everlasting blessings.

      Praise GOD: ye servants of the LORD,
      O praise, the LORD's name praise.
      Yea, blessèd be the name of GOD
      from this time forth always.

      From rising sun to where it sets,
      GOD's name is to be praised.
      Above all nations GOD is high,
      'bove heav'ns his glory raised.

      Unto the LORD our God that dwells
      on high, who can compare?
      Himself that humbleth things to see
      in heav'n and earth that are.

      He from the dust doth raise the poor,
      that very low doth lie;
      And from the dunghill lifts the man
      oppressed with poverty;

      That he may highly him advance,
      and with the princes set;
      With those that of his people are
      the chief, ev'n princes great.

      The barren woman house to keep
      he maketh, and to be
      Of sons a mother full of joy.
      Praise to the LORD give ye.

        This psalm, with the five immediately following, were called the great
        Hallelujah, and used to be sung at the Passover supper (Matt. 26:30).
        Here, (1.) We are solemnly called to celebrate the praises of God,
        ver. 1-3. (2.) We are plentifully furnished with matter of praise,
        viz. the heights of his glory and greatness, and the depths of his

      When Isr'el out of Egypt went,
      and did his dwelling change,
      When Jacob's house went out from those
      that were of language strange,

      He Judah did his sanctuary,
      his kingdom Isr'el make:
      The sea it saw, and quickly fled,
      Jordan was driven back.

      Like rams the mountains, and like lambs
      the hills skipped to and fro.
      O sea, why fledd'st thou? Jordan, back
      why wast thou driven so?

      Ye mountains great, wherefore was it
      that ye did skip like rams?
      And wherefore was it, little hills,
      that ye did leap like lambs?

      O at the presence of the Lord,
      earth, tremble thou for fear,
      While as the presence of the God
      of Jacob doth appear:

      Who from the hard and stony rock

      Not unto us, LORD, not to us,

      Unto thy name, ev'n for thy truth,
      and for thy mercy's sake.

      O wherefore should the heathen say,
      Where is their God now gone?
      But our God in the heavens is,
      what pleased him he hath done.

      Their idols silver are and gold,
      work of men's hands they be.
      Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
      and eyes, but do not see;

      Ears have they, but they do not hear;
      noses, but savour not;
      Hands, feet, but handle not, nor walk;
      nor speak they through their throat.

      Like them their makers are, and all
      on them their trust that build.
      O Isr'el, trust thou in the LORD,
      he is their help and shield.

      O Aaron's house, trust in the LORD,
      their help and shield is he.
      Ye that fear God, trust in the LORD,
      their help and shield he'll be.

      The LORD of us hath mindful been,
      and he will bless us still:
      He will the house of Isr'el bless,
      bless Aaron's house he will.

      Both small and great, that fear the LORD,
      he will them surely bless.
      The LORD will you, you and your seed,
      aye more and more increase.

      O blessèd are ye of the LORD,
      who made the earth and heav'n.
      The heav'n, ev'n heav'ns, are GOD's, but he
      earth to men's sons hath giv'n.

      The dead, nor who to silence go,
      GOD's praise do not record.
      But henceforth we for ever will
      bless GOD. Praise ye the LORD.

        This psalm instructs us, (1.) To whom glory and praise ought to be
        ascribed: not to ourselves, but to God's mercy and truth, ver. 1; not
        to lifeless, senseless idols, but to God, whose throne is in the
        heavens, and who doeth whatever he pleaseth, ver. 2-8, 15-16. (2.) How
        we are to glorify God: 1. By trusting in him, crediting his promise
        and receiving his blessings, ver. 9-15. 2. By blessing him while we
        live, ver. 17-18.<br/><br/><br/>Learn, my soul, to deny thyself; to
        take up thy cross and follow Christ; and to keep thyself from idols.
        But, make Jehovah, as reconciled in Christ, thy portion, thy trust,
        thy help, thy shield, thy blessedness, thy comfort, thy praise; and
        consider thine earthly enjoyments as the gracious gifts of thy God,
        and an earnest of thy far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

      I love the LORD, because my voice
      and prayers he did hear.
      I, while I live, will call on him,
      who bowed to me his ear.

      Of death the cords and sorrows did
      about me compass round;
      The pains of hell took hold on me,
      I grief and trouble found.

      Upon the name of God the LORD
      then did I call, and say,
      Deliver thou my soul, O LORD,
      I do thee humbly pray.

      GOD merciful and righteous is,
      yea, gracious is our LORD.
      GOD saves the meek: I was brought low,
      he did me help afford.

      O thou my soul, do thou return
      unto thy quiet rest;
      For largely, lo, the LORD to thee
      his bounty hath expressed.

      For my distressèd soul from death
      delivered was by thee:
      Thou didst my mourning eyes from tears,
      my feet from falling, free.

      I in the land of those that live
      will walk the LORD before.
      I did believe, therefore I spake:
      I was afflicted sore.

      I said, when I was in my haste,
      that all men liars be.
      What shall I render to the LORD
      for all his gifts to me?

      I'll of salvation take the cup,
      on GOD's name will I call:
      I'll pay my vows now to the LORD
      before his people all.

      Dear in GOD's sight is his saints' death.
      Thy servant, LORD, am I;
      Thy servant sure, thine handmaid's son:
      my bands thou didst untie.

      Thank-off'rings I to thee will give,
      and on GOD's name will call.
      I'll pay my vows now to the LORD
      before his people all;

      Within the courts of GOD's own house,
      within the midst of thee,
      O city of Jerusalem.

        This is a psalm of thanksgiving, somewhat similar to the 18th, 30th,
        40th, and 103rd; and represents, (1.) The psalmist's great distress
        and danger, which had almost driven him to despair, ver. 3, 10-11.
        (2.) The application he made to God by prayer, for relief; and his
        experience of God's gracious kindness, in granting his requests, in
        hearing, pitying, and delivering him, ver. 1-2, 4-6, 8. (3.) His
        sincere and hearty resolutions, to make a grateful acknowledgment of
        God's kindness; by loving him, ver. 1; continuing to call on him and
        receive from him, ver. 2, 13, 17; resting in him, ver. 7; walking
        before him as his devoted servant, ver. 9, 16; public confession of
        God's tender regard to him, ver. 12, 15; and sincere and public paying
        of his vows to God, ver. 10-19.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me
        think, as before God, what of these blessings I have experienced -
        what of these duties I have earnestly practised. If God hath redeemed
        me from the broken law; from the lowest hell; from the mouth of the
        infernal lion; and from the power of my corrupt lusts: then let my
        soul, and all that is within me, be stirred up to bless his holy name;
        and let me never lose the heart-animating impressions of his benefits.

      Let those that fear the LORD now say,

      I in distress called on the LORD;

      He in a large place did me set,

      The mighty LORD is on my side,
      I will not be afraid;
      For anything that man can do

      The LORD doth take my part with them

      They compassed me about; I say,
      they compassed me about:

      Like bees they compassed me about;
      like unto thorns that flame
      They quenchèd are: for them shall I
      destroy in GOD's own name.

      Thou sore hast thrust, that I might fall,
      but my LORD helpèd me.
      GOD my salvation is become,
      my strength and song is he.

      In dwellings of the rïghteous
      is heard the melody
      Of joy and health: the LORD's right hand
      doth ever valiantly.

      The right hand of the mighty LORD
      exalted is on high;
      The right hand of the mighty LORD
      doth ever valiantly.

      I shall not die, but live, and shall
      the works of GOD discover.
      The LORD hath me chastisèd sore,
      but not to death given over.

      O set ye open unto me
      the gates of righteousness;
      Then will I enter into them,
      and I the LORD will bless.

      This is the gate of GOD, by it
      the just shall enter in.
      Thee will I praise, for thou me heard'st,
      and hast my safety been.

      That stone is made head cornerstone,
      which builders did despise:
      This is the doing of the LORD,
      and wondrous in our eyes.

      This is the day GOD made, in it
      we'll joy triumphantly.
      Save now, I pray thee, LORD; I pray,
      send now prosperity.

      Blessèd is he in GOD's great name
      that cometh us to save:
      We, from the house which to the LORD
      pertains, you blessèd have.

      God is the LORD, who unto us
      hath made light to arise:
      Bind ye unto the altar's horns
      with cords the sacrifice.

      Thou art my God, I'll thee exalt;

        praise the Lord, for his everlasting mercy and kindness, ver. 1-4.
        (2.) By a recital of the great and gracious things which God had done
        for him, he encourageth himself and others to trust in God alone, ver.
        5-18. (3.) His thanksgivings for God's advancement of him to the
        throne, notwithstanding of all opposition - as typical of the
        exaltation of Jesus Christ, ver. 19-23. (4.) His, and the priests' and
        people's triumph, in the expected prosperity of his reign; and of the
        flourishing of the kingdom of Christ, ver. 24-29.<br/><br/><br/>While
        I sing, let my soul soar aloft to Jesus and his sure mercies. Let me
        behold him, who for the suffering of death was made a little lower
        than the angels, now crowned with glory and honour; having all his
        enemies put under his feet, but himself invested with all power in
        heaven and in earth; and furnished with all gifts for men, yea, for
        the rebellious also, that God the Lord may dwell among them; and, as
        the God of their salvation, daily load them with benefits. Let me
        rejoice in his highness, and have myself, and all my services, bound
        with cords to his altar. And God forbid I should conclude the notes,
        without entering into the very marrow of the sense. Thou art My God,

      with their whole heart and mind.

      Such in his ways do walk, and they

      Thou hast commanded us to keep

      make me aright to know;

      My soul doth melt, and drop away,
      for heaviness and grief:
      To me, according to thy word,
      give strength, and send relief.

      From me the wicked way of lies
      let far removèd be;
      And graciously thy holy law
      do thou grant unto me.

      I chosen have the perfect way

      For on thy judgments rïghteous
      my hope doth still rely.

      So shall I keep for evermore
      thy law continually.
      And, sith that I thy precepts seek,
      I'll walk at liberty.

      I'll speak thy word to kings, and I
      with shame shall not be moved;
      And will delight myself always
      in thy laws, which I loved.

      To thy commandments, which I loved,
      my hands lift up I will;
      And I will also meditate
      upon thy statutes still.

      Zain

      Remember, Lord, thy gracious word
      thou to thy servant spake,
      Which, for a ground of my sure hope,
      thou causedst me to take.

      This word of thine my comfort is
      in mine afflïction:
      For in my straits I am revived
      by this thy word alone.

      The men whose hearts with pride are stuffed
      did greatly me deride;
      Yet from thy straight commändments
      I have not turned aside.

      Thy judgments rïghteous, O LORD,
      which thou of old forth gave,
      I did remember, and myself
      by them comforted have.

      Horror took hold on me, because
      ill men thy law forsake.
      I in my house of pilgrimage
      thy laws my songs do make.

      Thy name by night, LORD, I did mind,
      and I have kept thy law.
      And this I had, because thy word
      I kept, and stood in awe.

      Cheth

      Thou my sure portion art alone,
      which I did choose, O LORD:
      I have resolved, and said, that I
      would keep thy holy word.

      With my whole heart I did entreat
      thy face and favour free:
      According to thy gracious word
      be merciful to me.

      I thought upon my former ways,
      and did my life well try;
      And to thy testimonies pure
      my feet then turnèd I.

      I did not stay, nor linger long,
      as those that slothful are;
      But hastily thy laws to keep
      myself I did prepare.

      Bands of ill men me robbed; yet I
      thy precepts did not slight.
      I'll rise at midnight thee to praise,
      ev'n for thy judgments right.

      I am companion to all those
      who fear, and thee obey.
      O LORD, thy mercy fills the earth:
      teach me thy laws, I pray.

      Teth

      Well hast thou with thy servant dealt,
      as thou didst promise give.
      Good judgment me, and knowledge teach,
      for I thy word believe.

      Ere I afflicted was I strayed;
      but now I keep thy word.
      Both good thou art, and good thou do'st:
      teach me thy statutes, Lord.

      The men that are puffed up with pride
      against me forged a lie;
      Yet thy commändments observe
      with my whole heart will I.

      Their hearts, through worldly ease and wealth,
      as fat as grease they be:
      But in thy holy law I take
      delight continually.

      It hath been very good for me
      that I afflicted was,
      That I might well instructed be,
      and learn thy holy laws.

      The word that cometh from thy mouth
      is better unto me
      Than many thousands and great sums
      of gold and silver be.

      Jod

      Thou mad'st and fashion'dst me: thy laws
      to know give wisdom, Lord.
      So who thee fear shall joy to see
      me trusting in thy word.

      That very right thy judgments are
      I know, and do confess;
      And that thou hast afflicted me
      in truth and faithfulness.

      O let thy kindness merciful,
      I pray thee, comfort me,
      As to thy servant faithfully
      was promisèd by thee.

      And let thy tender mercies come
      to me, that I may live;
      Because thy holy laws to me
      sweet delectation give.

      Lord, let the proud ashamèd be;
      for they, without a cause,
      With me perversely dealt: but I
      will muse upon thy laws.

      Let such as fear thee, and have known
      thy statutes, turn to me.
      My heart let in thy laws be sound,
      that shamed I never be.

      Caph

      My soul for thy salvation faints;
      yet I thy word believe.
      Mine eyes fail for thy word: I say,
      When wilt thou comfort give?

      For like a bottle I'm become,
      that in the smoke is set:
      I'm black, and parched with grief; yet I
      thy statutes not forget.

      How many are thy servant's days?
      when wilt thou execute
      Just judgment on these wicked men
      that do me persecute?

      The proud have diggèd pits for me,
      which is against thy laws.
      Thy words all faithful are: help me,
      pursued without a cause.

      They so consumed me, that on earth
      my life they scarce did leave:
      Thy precepts yet forsook I not,
      but close to them did cleave.

      After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
      me quicken, and preserve:
      The testimony of thy mouth
      so shall I still observe.

      Lamed

      Thy word for ever is, O LORD,
      in heaven settled fast;
      Unto all generätions
      thy faithfulness doth last:

      The earth thou hast establishèd,
      and it abides by thee.
      This day they stand as thou ordain'dst;
      for all thy servants be.

      Unless in thy most perfect law
      my soul delights had found,
      I should have perishèd, when as
      my troubles did abound.

      Thy precepts I will ne'er forget;
      they quick'ning to me brought.
      Lord, I am thine; O save thou me:
      thy precepts I have sought.

      For me the wicked have laid wait,
      me seeking to destroy:
      But I thy testimonies true
      consider will with joy.

      An end of all perfëction
      here have I seen, O God:
      But as for thy commändment,
      it is exceeding broad.

      Mem

      O how love I thy law! it is
      my study all the day:
      It makes me wiser than my foes;
      for it doth with me stay.

      Than all my teachers now I have
      more understanding far;
      Because my meditätion
      thy testimonies are.

      In understanding I excel
      those that are äncients;
      For I endeavourèd to keep
      all thy commändments.

      My feet from each ill way I stayed,
      that I may keep thy word.
      I from thy judgments have not swerved;
      for thou hast taught me, Lord.

      How sweet unto my taste, O Lord,
      are all thy words of truth!
      Yea, I do find them sweeter far
      than honey to my mouth.

      I through thy precepts, that are pure,
      do understanding get;
      I therefore ev'ry way that's false
      with all my heart do hate.

      Nun

      Thy word is to my feet a lamp,
      and to my path a light.
      I sworn have, and I will perform,
      to keep thy judgments right.

      I am with sore afflïction
      ev'n overwhelmed, O LORD:
      In mercy raise and quicken me,
      according to thy word.

      The freewill off'rings of my mouth
      accept, I thee beseech:
      And unto me thy servant, LORD,
      thy judgments clearly teach.

      Though still my soul be in my hand,
      thy laws I'll not forget.
      I erred not from them, though for me
      the wicked snares did set.

      I of thy testimonies have
      above all things made choice,
      To be my heritage for aye;
      for they my heart rejoice.

      I carefully inclinèd have
      my heart still to attend;
      That I thy statutes may perform
      alway unto the end.

      Samech

      I hate the thoughts of vanity,
      but love thy law do I.
      My shield and hiding-place thou art:
      I on thy word rely.

      All ye that evil-doers are
      from me depart away;
      For the commandments of my God
      I purpose to obey.

      According to thy faithful word
      uphold and stablish me,
      That I may live, and of my hope
      ashamèd never be.

      Hold thou me up, so shall I be
      in peace and safety still;
      And to thy statutes have respect
      continually I will.

      Thou tread'st down all that love to stray;
      false their deceit doth prove.
      Lewd men, like dross, away thou putt'st;
      therefore thy law I love.

      For fear of thee my very flesh
      doth tremble, all dismayed;
      And of thy righteous judgments, Lord,
      my soul is much afraid.

      Ain

      To all men I have judgment done,
      performing justice right;
      Then let me not be left unto
      my fierce oppressors' might.

      For good unto thy servant, Lord,
      thy servant's surety be:
      From the oppression of the proud
      do thou deliver me.

      Mine eyes do fail with looking long
      for thy salvätion,
      The word of thy pure righteousness
      while I do wait upon.

      In mercy with thy servant deal,
      thy laws me teach and show.
      I am thy servant, wisdom give,
      that I thy laws may know.

      'Tis time thou work, LORD; for they have
      made void thy law divine.
      Therefore thy precepts more I love
      than gold, yea, gold most fine.

      Concerning all things thy commands
      all right I judge therefore;
      And ev'ry false and wicked way
      I perfectly abhor.

      Pe

      Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful,
      my soul them keeps with care.
      The entrance of thy words gives light,
      makes wise who simple are.

      My mouth I have wide openèd,
      and panted earnestly,
      While after thy commändments
      I longed exceedingly.

      Look on me, Lord, and merciful
      do thou unto me prove,
      As thou art wont to do to those
      thy name who truly love.

      O let my footsteps in thy word
      aright still ordered be:
      Let no iniquity obtain
      dominion over me.

      From man's oppression save thou me;
      so keep thy laws I will.
      Thy face make on thy servant shine;
      teach me thy statutes still.

      Rivers of waters from mine eyes
      did run down, when I saw
      How wicked men run on in sin,
      and do not keep thy law.

      Tsaddi

      O LORD, thou art most rïghteous;
      thy judgments are upright.
      Thy testimonies thou command'st
      most faithful are and right.

      My zeal hath ev'n consumèd me,
      because mine enemies
      Thy holy words forgotten have,
      and do thy laws despise.

      Thy word's most pure, therefore on it
      thy servant's love is set.
      Small, and despised I am, yet I
      thy precepts not forget.

      Thy righteousness is righteousness
      which ever doth endure:
      Thy holy law, Lord, also is
      the very truth most pure.

      Trouble and anguish have me found,
      and taken hold on me:
      Yet in my trouble my delight
      thy just commandments be.

      Eternal righteousness is in
      thy testimonies all:
      Lord, to me understanding give,
      and ever live I shall.

      Koph

      With my whole heart I cried, LORD, hear;
      I will thy word obey.
      I cried to thee; save me, and I
      will keep thy laws alway.

      I of the morning did prevent
      the dawning, and did cry:
      For all mine expectätion
      did on thy word rely.

      Mine eyes did timeously prevent
      the watches of the night.
      That in thy word with careful mind
      then meditate I might.

      After thy loving-kindness hear
      my voice, that calls on thee:
      According to thy judgment, LORD,
      revive and quicken me.

      Who follow mischief they draw nigh;
      they from thy law are far:
      But thou art near, LORD; most firm truth
      all thy commandments are.

      As for thy testimonies all,
      of old this have I tried,
      That thou hast surely founded them
      for ever to abide.

      Resh

      Consider mine afflïction,
      in safety do me set:
      Deliver me, O Lord, for I
      thy law do not forget.

      After thy word revive thou me:
      save me, and plead my cause.
      Salvation is from sinners far;
      for they seek not thy laws.

      O LORD, both great and manifold
      thy tender mercies be:
      According to thy judgments just,
      revive and quicken me.

      My persecutors many are,
      and foes that do combine;
      Yet from thy testimonies pure
      my heart doth not decline.

      I saw transgressors, and was grieved;
      for they keep not thy word.
      See how I love thy law! as thou
      art kind, me quicken, LORD.

      From the beginning all thy word
      hath been most true and sure:
      Thy righteous judgments ev'ry one
      for evermore endure.

      Schin

      Princes have persecuted me,
      although no cause they saw:
      But still of thy most holy word
      my heart doth stand in awe.

      I at thy word rejoice, as one
      of spoil that finds great store.
      Thy law I love; but lying all
      I hate and do abhor.

      Sev'n times a-day it is my care
      to give due praise to thee;
      Because of all thy judgments, Lord,
      which righteous ever be.

      Great peace have they who love thy law;
      offence they shall have none.
      I hoped for thy salvation, LORD,
      and thy commands have done.

      My soul thy testimonies pure
      observèd carefully;
      On them my heart is set, and them
      I love exceedingly.

      Thy testimonies and thy laws
      I kept with special care;
      For all my works and ways each one
      before thee open are.

      Tau

      O let my earnest pray'r and cry
      come near before thee, LORD:
      Give understanding unto me,
      according to thy word.

      Let my request before thee come:
      after thy word me free.
      My lips shall utter praise, when thou
      hast taught thy laws to me.

      My tongue of thy most blessèd word
      shall speak, and it confess;
      Because all thy commändments
      are perfect righteousness.

      Let thy strong hand make help to me:
      thy precepts are my choice.
      I longed for thy salvation, LORD,
      and in thy law rejoice.

      O let my soul live, and it shall
      give praises unto thee;
      And let thy judgments gräcious
      be helpful unto me.

      I, like a lost sheep, went astray;
      thy servant seek, and find:
      For thy commands I suffered not
      to slip out of my mind.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        "This psalm is a collection of David's precious thoughts, sorrowful
        complaints, humble petitions, and holy resolutions, which, it seems he
        had written down as they occurred, and which, in the end of his life,
        he digested into the form in which they now stand, consisting of as
        many parts as there are letters in the Hebrew alphabet, the eight
        verses of each always beginning with the same letter in the original.
        The general scope of it is to magnify God's word, and make it
        honourable. To intimate that it informs us of whatever we ought to
        expect from God in the way of gracious donation, and of whatever he may
        expect from us in the way of grateful returns of duty, it is
        represented under ten different characters, one or other of which is to
        be found in every verse, except the 122nd and 132nd:

        - As God's Law, because framed and published by him as our Sovereign

        - His Commandments, because given with authority, and lodged with us as
          a trust

        - His Precepts, because peremptorily prescribed, and not left as a
          thing indifferent

        - His Statutes, because fixed and determined, and of perpetual
          obligation

        - His Word, because it is the declaration of his mind, and Christ, his
          essential Word, is all and in all therein -

        - His Way, because it represents Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the
          Life, and is the rule of our faith and obedience

        - His Testimonies, because therein God, upon his word, his oath, and
          writ, declares to men the truths necessary to be known, in order to
          his honour and their salvation, as ratified in the death of his Son

        - His Judgments, because it is framed in infinite wisdom, and by it we
          must both judge and be judged (but in verses 75, 84, 121,
          judgment denotes righteous conduct) - His Righteousness, because it is
          holy, just, and good, and is the perfect standard of righteousness

        - And his Truth, or Faithfulness, because its leading truths are
          eternal, and the faithfulness of God is pledged in every point
          thereof.

        While I sing, let me all along enter into the spirit of the psalm. Let
        my delight be in God's testimonies; my desires after God's presence;
        and my endeavours to have God honoured. Let God's word be my rule, my
        food, my armour, my wealth, my comfort; and God himself, as therein
        revealed and bestowed, be my everlasting and infinite all."

        Why this psalm and the fourteen following, are called songs of
        degrees, we do not certainly know. It is plain, some of them are
        suited to secret worship, some to the family, and others to the public
        assembly. This psalm, from its affinity to the 52nd, is supposed to
        refer to Doeg the Edomite, 1 Sam. 22. We have, (1.) The psalmist's
        prayer to God for deliverance from the ruinous influence of malicious
        and false accusations, ver. 1-2. (2.) His denunciation of the just,
        fearful, and lasting judgments of God against his malicious accusers,
        ver. 3-4. (3.) His complaints of his quarrelsome and vexatious
        neighbours, ver. 5-7.<br/><br/><br/>Never dare, my soul, to utter
        falsehood, or even truth in a malicious manner. Never dare to rush
        upon the fierce and lasting indignation of the Almighty. Never choose
        to make this world thy country, where sin and troubles so abound. But,
        ye blessed abodes of peace and purity, when shall I come to you! When
        shall I leave my evil neighbours, and come to God, to God my exceeding
        joy.

      I joyed when to the house of GOD,
      Go up, they said to me.
      Jerusalem, within thy gates
      our feet shall standing be.

      Jerus'lem, as a city, is
      compactly built together:
      Unto that place the tribes go up,
      the tribes of GOD go thither:

      To Isr'el's testimony, there
      to GOD's name thanks to pay.
      For thrones of judgment, ev'n the thrones
      of David's house, there stay.

      Pray that Jerusalem may have
      peace and felicity:
      Let them that love thee and thy peace
      have still prosperity.

      Therefore I wish that peace may still
      within thy walls remain,
      And ever may thy palaces
      prosperity retain.

      Now, for my friends' and brethren's sakes,
      Peace be in thee, I'll say.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm appears to have been composed for the use of the Hebrews at
        their three solemn feasts, Lev. 23. We have in it, (1.) Expressions of
        great joy in going up to Jerusalem, ver. 1-2. (2.) High commendations
        of the beauty, order, sanctity, and honour of Jerusalem, ver. 3-5.
        (3.) The duty and happiness of such as are really concerned for the
        welfare of Jerusalem, the church of God, ver. 6-9.<br/><br/><br/>While
        I sing, let me remember the gospel church, bewail her disorders,
        supplicate for her welfare, and set my heart on the Jerusalem which is
        above, and into which nothing can enter that defileth or disturbs. O
        when shall my feet stand there! When shall I see my Jesus, on his
        great white throne, and sit with him in his glory.

      O thou that dwellest in the heav'ns,
      I lift mine eyes to thee.
      Behold, as servants' eyes do look

      As handmaid's eyes her mistress' hand;
      so do our eyes attend
      Upon the LORD our God, until
      to us he mercy send.

      O LORD, be gräcious to us,
      unto us gracious be;
      Because replenished with contempt
      exceedingly are we.

      When cruel men against us furiously
      Rose up in wrath, to make of us their prey;

      Then certainly they had devoured us all,
      And swallowed quick, for ought that we could deem;
      Such was their rage, as we might well esteem.
      And as fierce floods before them all things drown,
      So had they brought our soul to death quite down.

      The raging streams, with their proud swelling waves,
      Had then our soul o'erwhelmèd in the deep.

        This psalm is highly applicable to every remarkable deliverance which
        God works for his church, especially to the great redemption wrought
        for his people by Christ. In it, (1.) David magnifies the danger they
        were in, ver. 1-5. (2.) Ascribes the glory of their deliverance to
        God, ver. 1-2, 6-7. (3.) Improves the deliverance as an encouragement
        to trust in God, ver. 8.<br/><br/><br/>Let me behold Jehovah as a
        present help in trouble. Let my waiting eyes be towards him, who,
        notwithstanding all the combined power and policy of hell and earth,
        is able and ready to pull my feet out of the net.

      Praise ye the LORD, the LORD's name praise;
      his servants, praise ye GOD.
      Who stand in GOD's house, in the courts
      of our God make abode.

      Praise ye the LORD, for he is good;
      unto him praises sing:
      Sing praises to his name, because
      it is a pleasant thing.

      For Jacob to himself the LORD
      did choose of his good pleasure,
      And he hath chosen Israel
      for his peculiar treasure.

      Because I know assuredly
      the LORD is very great,
      And that our Lord above all gods
      in glory hath his seat.

      What things soever pleased the LORD,
      that in the heav'n did he,
      And in the earth, the seas, and all
      the places deep that be.

      He from the ends of earth doth make
      the vapours to ascend;
      With rain he lightnings makes, and wind
      doth from his treasures send.

      Egypt's first-born, from man to beast
      who smote. Strange tokens he
      On Pharaoh and his servants sent,
      Egypt, in midst of thee.

      He smote great nations, slew great kings:
      Sihon of Heshbon king,
      And Og of Bashan, and to nought
      did Canaan's kingdoms bring:

      And for a wealthy heritage
      their pleasant land he gave,
      An heritage which Israèl,
      his chosen folk, should have.

      Thy name, O LORD, shall still endure,
      and thy memorial
      With honour shall continued be
      to generations all.

      For why? the righteous GOD will judge
      his people righteously;
      Concerning those that do him serve,
      himself repent will he.

      The idols of the nätions
      of silver are and gold,
      And by the hands of men is made
      their fäshion and mould.

      Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
      eyes, but they do not see;
      Ears have they, but hear not; and in
      their mouths no breathing be.

      Their makers are like them; so are
      all that on them rely.
      O Isr'el's house, bless GOD; bless GOD,
      O Aaron's family.

      O bless the LORD, of Levi's house
      ye who his servants are;
      And bless the holy name of GOD,
      all ye the LORD that fear.

      And blessèd be the LORD our God
      from Zion's holy hill,
      Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
      The LORD O praise ye still.

      Who through the desert led his own:

      Ev'n Sihon king of Amorites:
      for he hath mercy ever.
      And Og the king of Bashanites:
      for his grace faileth never.

      Their land in heritage to have:
      (for mercy hath he ever).
      His servant Isr'el right he gave:
      for his grace faileth never.

      In our low state who on us thought:
      for he hath mercy ever.
      And from our foes our freedom wrought:
      for his grace faileth never.

      Praise GOD, for he is kind:
      His mercy lasts for aye.
      Give thanks with heart and mind
      To God of gods alway:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      The Lord of lords praise ye,
      Whose mercies still endure.
      Great wonders only he
      Doth work by his great power:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      Which God omnipotent,
      By might and wisdom high,
      The heav'n and firmament
      Did frame, as we may see:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      To him who did outstretch
      This earth so great and wide,
      Above the waters' reach
      Making it to abide:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      Great lights he made to be;
      For his grace lasteth aye:
      Such as the sun we  see,
      To rule the lightsome day:
      For certainly his mercies dure

      To him that Egypt smote,
      Who did his message scorn;
      And in his anger hot
      Did kill all their first-born:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      Thence Isr'el out he brought;
      For his grace lasteth ever.
      With a strong hand he wrought,
      And stretched-out arm deliver:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      The sea he cut in two;
      For his grace lasteth still.
      And through its midst to go
      Made his own Israèl:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      But overwhelmed and lost
      Was proud king Pharàoh,
      With all his mighty host,
      And chariots there also:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      To him who pow'rfully
      His chosen people led,
      Ev'n through the desert dry,
      And in that place them fed:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      To him great kings who smote;

      Their land by lot he gave;
      For his grace faileth never,
      That Isr'el might it have
      In heritage for ever:
      For certainly his mercies dure
      Most firm and sure eternally.

      Who hath rememberèd
      Us in our low estate;

    commentary:

        This psalm is a continued exhortation to praise the Lord for the
        perpetual displays of his mercy. The hearty singing of it has been
        honoured with the most signal appearances of God's kindness, 2 Chron.
        5:13 and 20:21-22. We are in it directed to praise God, (1.) As great
        and good in himself, ver. 1-4. (2.) As the Creator of all things, ver
        5-9. (3.) As the God and Saviour of Israel, who brought them out of
        Egypt, through the Red sea and wilderness, and who cast out the
        nations, and gave them the possession of Canaan, ver. 10-22. (4.) As
        our gracious and condescending Redeemer, ver. 23-24. (5.) As the great
        and sovereign Benefactor of all creatures, ver.
        25-26.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing it, let my heart be melted, and all-
        inflamed, with the loving-kindness and mercy of God in Christ. Let me
        behold, believe, and admire the unbounded extent, and everlasting
        duration thereof.

      By Babel's streams we sat and wept,
      when Zion we thought on.
      In midst thereof we hanged our harps
      the willow-trees upon.

      For there a song requirèd they,
      who did us captive bring:
      Our spoilers called for mirth, and said,
      A song of Zion sing.

      O how the LORD's song shall we sing
      within a foreign land?
      If thee, Jerus'lem, I forget,
      skill part from my right hand.

      My tongue to my mouth's roof let cleave,
      if I do thee forget,
      Jerusalem, and thee above
      my chief joy do not set.

      Remember Edom's children, LORD,
      who in Jerus'lem's day,
      Ev'n unto its foundätion,
      Raze, raze it quite, did say.

      O daughter thou of Babylon,
      near to destrüction;
      Bless'd shall he be that thee rewards,
      as thou to us hast done.

      Yea, happy surely shall he be
      thy tender little ones
      Who shall lay hold upon, and them
      shall dash against the stones.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was probably composed in Chaldea, during the captivity, and
        contains, (1.) The Jews' grievous bewailing of their distress,
        contempt, and reproach, ver. 1, 4. (2.) Their tender and affectionate
        remembrance of, and concern for Jerusalem - the church and ordinances
        of God, ver. 5-6. (3.) Denunciations of destruction to the Edomites,
        who had promoted, and the Chaldeans, who had affected their distress
        and captivity, ver. 7-9.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let me bless the
        Lord for what mercy is my lot, above that of many others. Let the
        welfare of God's church lie near my heart. Let me earnestly desire,
        and firmly expect the ruin of all her and my spiritual foes.

      Thee will I praise with all my heart,
      I will sing praise to thee
      Before the gods: And worship will
      toward thy sanctuary.

      I'll praise thy name, ev'n for thy truth,
      and kindness of thy love;
      For thou thy word hast magnified
      all thy great name above.

      Thou didst me answer in the day
      when I to thee did cry;
      And thou my fainting soul with strength
      didst strengthen inwardly.

      All kings upon the earth that are
      shall give thee praise, O LORD;
      When as they from thy mouth shall hear
      thy true and faithful word.

      Yea, in the righteous ways of GOD
      with gladness they shall sing:
      For great's the glory of the LORD,
      who doth for ever reign.

      Though GOD be high, yet he respects
      all those that lowly be;
      Whereas the proud and lofty ones
      afar off knoweth he.

      Though I in midst of trouble walk,
      I life from thee shall have:
      'Gainst my foes' wrath thou'lt stretch thine hand;
      thy right hand shall me save.

      LORD, still thy mercy lasts; do not
      thine own hands' works forsake.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm was perhaps composed by David when he was newly advanced to
        his throne, 2 Sam. 5, 1 Chron. 12. In it, (1.) He looks back with
        thankfulness upon the experience he had of God's goodness to him, ver.
        1-3. (2.) He looks forward with comfort, in hopes that others would go
        on like him to praise God, ver. 4-5; and that God would continue to do
        good to him, ver. 6-8.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing these lofty lines,
        let the sense of the unnumbered mercies I have received from God, and
        the hopes of his everlasting loving-kindness, tune and animate my
        heart.

      O LORD, thou hast me searched and known.
      Thou know'st my sitting down,
      And rising up; yea, all my thoughts
      afar to thee are known.

      My footsteps, and my lying down,
      thou compassest always;
      Thou also most entirely art
      acquaint with all my ways.

      For in my tongue, before I speak,
      not any word can be,
      But altogether, lo, O LORD,
      it is well known to thee.

      Behind, before, thou hast beset,
      and laid on me thine hand.
      Such knowledge is too strange for me,
      too high to understand.

      From thy Spirit whither shall I go?
      or from thy presence fly?
      Ascend I heav'n, lo, thou art there;
      there, if in hell I lie.

      Take I the morning wings, and dwell
      in utmost parts of sea;
      Ev'n there, Lord, shall thy hand me lead,
      thy right hand hold shall me.

      If I do say that darkness shall
      me cover from thy sight,
      Then surely shall the very night
      about me be as light.

      Yea, darkness hideth not from thee,
      but night doth shine as day:
      To thee the darkness and the light
      are both alike alway.

      For thou possessèd hast my reins,
      and thou hast covered me,
      When I within my mother's womb
      inclosèd was by thee.

      Thee will I praise; for fearfully
      and strangely made I am;
      Thy works are marv'llous, and right well
      my soul doth know the same.

      My substance was not hid from thee,
      when as in secret I
      Was made; and in earth's lowest parts
      was wrought most curiously.

      Thine eyes my substance did behold,
      yet being unperfect;
      And in the volume of thy book
      my members all were writ;

      Which after in continuance
      were fashioned ev'ry one,
      When as they yet all shapeless were,
      and of them there was none.

      How precious also are thy thoughts,
      O gracious God, to me!
      And in their sum how passing great
      and numberless they be!

      If I should count them, than the sand
      they more in number be:
      What time soever I awake,
      I ever am with thee.

      Thou, Lord, wilt sure the wicked slay:
      hence from me bloody men.
      Thy foes against thee loudly speak,
      and take thy name in vain.

      Do not I hate all those, O LORD,
      that hatred bear to thee?
      With those that up against thee rise
      can I but grievèd be?

      With perfect hatred them I hate,
      my foes I them do hold.
      Search me, O God, and know my heart,
      try me, my thoughts unfold:

      And see if any wicked way
      there be at all in me;
      And in thine everlasting way
      to me a leader be.

      LORD, from the ill and froward man
      give me deliverance,
      And do thou safe preserve me from
      the man of violence:

      Who in their heart mischievous things
      are meditating ever;
      And they for war assembled are
      continually together.

      Much like unto a serpent's tongue
      their tongues they sharp do make;
      And underneath their lips there lies
      the poison of a snake.

      LORD, keep me from the wicked's hands,
      from vi'lent men me save;
      Who utterly to overthrow
      my goings purposed have.

      The proud for me a snare have hid,
      and cords; yea, they a net
      Have by the wayside for me spread;
      they gins for me have set.

      I said unto the LORD, Thou art
      my God: unto the cry
      Of all my supplicätions,
      LORD, do thine ear apply.

      O GOD the Lord, who art the strength
      of my salvätion:
      A cov'ring in the day of war
      my head thou hast put on.

      Unto the wicked man, O LORD,
      his wishes do not grant;
      Nor further thou his ill device,
      lest they themselves should vaunt.

      As for the head and chief of those
      about that compass me,
      Ev'n by the mischief of the lips
      let thou them covered be.

      Let burning coals upon them fall,
      them throw in fiery flame,
      And in deep pits, that they no more
      may rise out of the same.

      Let not an evil speaker be
      on earth establishèd:
      Mischief shall hunt the vi'lent man,
      till he be ruinèd.

      I know GOD will th' afflicted's cause
      maintain, and poor men's right.
      Surely the just shall praise thy name;
      th' upright dwell in thy sight.

        God's preservation from them, ver. 1-5. (2.) He encourageth himself in

      O LORD, I unto thee do cry,
      do thou make haste to me,
      And give an ear unto my voice,
      when I cry unto thee.

      As incense let my prayer be
      directed in thine eyes;
      And the uplifting of my hands
      as th' ev'ning sacrifice.

      Set, LORD, a watch before my mouth,
      keep of my lips the door.
      My heart incline thou not unto
      the ills I should abhor,

      To practise wicked works with men
      that work iniquity;
      And with their delicates my taste
      let me not satisfy.

      Let him that righteous is me smite,
      it shall a kindness be;
      Let him reprove, I shall it count
      a precious oil to me:

      Such smiting shall not break my head;
      for yet the time shall fall,
      When I in their calamities
      to God pray for them shall.

      When as their judges down shall be
      in stony places cast,
      Then shall they hear my words; for they
      shall sweet be to their taste.

      About the grave's devouring mouth
      our bones are scattered round,
      As wood which men do cut and cleave
      lies scattered on the ground.

      But unto thee, O GOD the Lord,
      mine eyes uplifted be:
      My soul do not leave destitute;
      my trust is set on thee.

      Lord, keep me safely from the snares
      which they for me prepare;
      And from the subtle gins of them
      that wicked workers are.

      Let workers of iniquity
      into their own nets fall,
      Whilst I do, by thine help, escape
      the danger of them all.

        This psalm was likewise composed under distress and persecution. In it
        David prays, (1.) For God's kind acceptance of his prayers, ver. 1-2.
        (2.) For his powerful assistance in keeping his tongue, his heart, and
        hand, in the way of duty, ver. 3-4. (3.) That others might be helpful
        to him with their seasonable reproofs; and he to them with his
        prayers, ver. 5-6. (4.) That when he and his friends were brought to
        the last extremity, God would graciously appear for their relief, ver.
        7-10.<br/><br/><br/>When I am afflicted, let me pray. Let me highly
        prize and kindly receive Christian reproof, and earnestly improve it
        to my spiritual advantage. Nor let me ever despair, on account of the
        great distress of my soul, or of the church. Is any thing too hard for
        the Lord?

      I with my voice cried to the LORD,
      with it made my request:
      Poured out to him my plaint, to him
      my trouble I expressed.

      When in me was o'erwhelmed my spirit,
      then well thou knew'st my way;
      Where I did walk a snare for me
      they privily did lay.

      I looked on my right hand, and viewed,
      but none to know me were;
      All refuge failèd me, no man
      did for my soul take care.

      I cried to thee; I said, Thou art
      my refuge, LORD, alone;
      And in the land of those that live
      thou art my pörtion.

      Because I am brought very low,
      attend unto my cry:
      Me from my persecutors save,
      who stronger are than I.

      From prison bring my soul, that I

      LORD, hear my pray'r, attend my suits;
      and in thy faithfulness
      Give thou an answer unto me,
      and in thy righteousness.

      Thy servant also bring thou not
      in judgment to be tried:
      Because no living man can be
      in thy sight justified.

      For th' en'my hath pursued my soul,

      In darkness he hath made me dwell,

      I of thy hands do muse.

      My hands to thee I stretch; my soul

      Thy Spirit is good, me to the land

      Revive and quicken me, O LORD,
      ev'n for thine own name's sake;

      Oh, hear my prayer, LORD,

      And, in thy faithfulness,
      Unto me answer make,
      And, in thy righteousness,
      Upon me pity take.

      In judgment enter not
      With me thy servant poor;
      For why, this well I wot,
      No sinner can endure
      The sight of thee, O God:
      If thou his deeds shalt try,
      He dare make none abode
      Himself to justify.

      Behold, the cruel foe
      Me persecutes with spite,
      My soul to overthrow:
      Yea, he my life down quite
      Unto the ground hath smote,

      In darkness, as forgot,
      Or men dead long ago.

      Therefore my spirit much vexed,
      O'erwhelmed is me within;
      My heart right sore perplexed
      And desolate hath been.
      Yet I do call to mind
      What ancient days record,

      My thirsting soul desires,
      And longeth after thee,
      As thirsty ground requires
      With rain refreshed to be.

      LORD, let my pray'r prevail,
      To answer it make speed;

      Hide not thy face in need;
      Lest I be like to those
      That do in darkness sit,
      Or him that downward goes
      Into the dreadful pit.

      Because I trust in thee,
      O Lord, cause me to hear
      Thy loving-kindness free,
      When morning doth appear:
      Cause me to know the way
      Wherein my path should be;
      For why, my soul on high
      I do lift up to thee.

      From my fierce enemy
      In safety do me guide,
      Because I flee to thee,
      LORD, that thou may'st me hide.
      My God alone art thou,
      Teach me thy righteousness:
      Thy Spirit 's good, lead me to
      The land of uprightness.

      O LORD, for thy name's sake,
      Be pleased to quicken me;
      And, for thy truth, forth take
      My soul from misery.
      And of thy grace destroy

        deliver him out of trouble, ver.9, 11; and, in fine, punish his

      deliverer, and shield,
      In whom I trust: who under me

      LORD, what is man, that thou of him

      Man is like vanity; his days,

      O free me from strange children's hand,

      That, as the plants, our sons may be
      in youth grown up that are;
      Our daughters like to corner-stones,
      carved like a palace fair.

      That to afford all kind of store
      our garners may be filled;
      That our sheep thousands, in our streets
      ten thousands they may yield.

      That strong our oxen be for work,
      that no in-breaking be,
      Nor going out; and that our streets
      may from complaints be free.

      Those people blessèd are who be

      The LORD upholdeth all that fall,
      The cast-down raiseth up again.

      The eyes of all things, Lord, attend,
      And on thee wait that here do live,
      And thou, in season due, dost send
      Sufficient food them to relieve.

      Yea, thou thine hand dost open wide,
      And ev'rything dost satisfy
      That lives, and doth on earth abide,
      Of thy great liberality.

      The LORD is just in his ways all,
      And holy in his works each one.
      He's near to all that on him call,
      Who call in truth on him alone.

      God will the just desire fulfil
      Of such as do him fear and dread:
      Their cry regard, and hear he will,
      And save them in the time of need.

      The LORD preserves all, more and less,
      That bear to him a loving heart:
      But workers all of wickedness
      Destroy will he, and clean subvert.

      Therefore my mouth and lips I'll frame

        This psalm, like the 25th, 34th, 111th, 112th, and 119th, is composed
        in an alphabetical form. It, and the five which follow, consist of
        pure praises to God, without so much as one complaint or petition.
        Here, (1.) David engageth himself, and encourageth others to praise
        God, ver. 1-7, 10, 21. (2.) He represents the grounds of praise, viz
        the greatness and glory, sovereign power, and eternity of God, and the
        greatness and glory of his works, ver. 3-7, 11-13; his unbounded
        goodness, mercy, and compassion, ver. 7-9; manifested in pitying the
        afflicted, providing what is necessary for all creatures; and in his
        readiness to hear and answer his people's prayers, preserve them from
        evil, and destroy their enemies, ver. 14-20.<br/><br/><br/>In such
        high praises of God, may all my prayers issue at last. And the nearer
        I approach to mine end, let my heart and lips be the more filled with
        his praise, and honour all the day. While I live on earth, let me
        publish the heart-engaging wonders of the nature and works of my God.

      Praise GOD. The LORD praise, O my soul.
      I'll praise GOD while I live;
      While I have being to my God
      in songs I'll praises give.

      Trust not in princes, nor man's son,
      in whom there is no stay:
      His breath departs, to 's earth he turns;
      that day his thoughts decay.

      O happy is that man and blest,
      whom Jacob's God doth aid;
      Whose hope upon the LORD doth rest,
      and on his God is stayed:

      Who made the earth and heavens high,
      who made the swelling deep,
      And all that is within the same;
      who truth doth ever keep:

      Who righteous judgment executes
      for those oppressed that be,
      Who to the hungry giveth food;
      GOD sets the pris'ners free.

      The LORD doth give the blind their sight,
      the bowèd down doth raise:
      The LORD doth dearly love all those
      that walk in upright ways.

      The stranger's shield, the widow's stay,
      the orphan's help, is he:
      But yet by him the wicked's way
      turn'd upside down shall be.

      The LORD shall reign for evermore:
      thy God, O Zion, he
      Reigns to all generätions.
      Praise to the LORD give ye.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        This psalm contains, (1.) Pleasant engagements and encouragements to
        the hearty and constant praises of God, ver. 1-2, 10. (2.) Earnest
        dissuasives from trusting in man, who is so weak and short-lived, ver.
        3-4. (3.) Powerful persuasives to trust in God, whose power and
        goodness appear so remarkable in creation, providence, and redemption,
        ver. 5-10.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, be stirred up, my soul, and all
        that is within me, to bless his holy name; to depend on him alone, who
        is my Maker, my faithful Friend, my kind and righteous Protector, my
        bountiful Provider, my almighty Deliverer, my gracious Enlightener, my
        seasonable Restorer, my perpetual Preserver, and the just punisher of
        my foes - my King, my God, and my all.

      Praise ye the LORD; for it is good
      praise to our God to sing:
      For it is pleasant, and to praise
      it is a comely thing.

      GOD doth build up Jerusalem;
      and he it is alone
      That the dispersed of Israel
      doth gather into one.

      Those that are broken in their heart,
      and grievèd in their minds,
      He healeth, and their painful wounds
      he tenderly up-binds.

      He counts the number of the stars;
      he names them ev'ry one.
      Great is our Lord, and of great pow'r;
      his wisdom search can none.

      The LORD lifts up the meek; and casts
      the wicked to the ground.
      Sing to the LORD, and give him thanks;
      on harp his praises sound;

      Who covereth the heav'n with clouds,
      who for the earth below
      Prepareth rain, who maketh grass
      upon the mountains grow.

      He gives the beast his food, he feeds
      the ravens young that cry.
      His pleasure not in horses' strength,
      nor in man's legs, doth lie.

      But in all those that do him fear
      the LORD doth pleasure take;
      In those that to his mercy do
      by hope themselves betake.

      The LORD praise, O Jerusalem;
      Zion, thy God confess:
      For thy gates' bars he maketh strong;
      thy sons in thee doth bless.

      He in thy borders maketh peace;
      with fine wheat filleth thee.
      He sends forth his command on earth,
      his word runs speedily.

      Hoar-frost, like ashes, scatt'reth he;
      like wool he snow doth give:
      Like morsels casteth forth his ice;
      who in its cold can live?

      He sendeth forth his mighty word,
      and melteth them again;
      His wind he makes to blow, and then
      the waters flow amain.

      The doctrine of his holy word
      to Jacob he doth show;
      His statutes and his judgments he
      gives Israèl to know.

      To any nation never he
      such favour did afford;
      For they his judgments have not known.
      O do ye praise the LORD.

        This psalm was probably penned by David, while he repaired and

        praise God, ver. 1, 7, 12, 20. (2.) Weighty reasons for praising God,
        viz. 1. That, as the God of nature, he is infinitely intelligent and
        great, and the sovereign manager of all creatures, ver. 4-5, 8-9, 15,
        18. 2. As the God of grace, he tenderly comforts, and affectionately
        delights in his people, ver. 3, 6, 10-11. 3. As the God of Israel,
        Jerusalem, and Zion, he settles their civil and religious state, ver.
        2, 13-14, 19-20.<br/><br/><br/>When God manifests himself in so many
        things, be ashamed, my soul, that I discern him in so few. O to see
        God's power and glory in every work of his hand, and especially in
        every word of his mouth! And to be so affected with what he is, and
        hath done, and will do, as in every thing to give thanks.

      Praise GOD. From heavens praise the LORD,
      in heights praise to him be.
      All ye his angels, praise ye him;
      his hosts all, praise him ye.

      O praise ye him, both sun and moon;
      praise him, all stars of light.
      Ye heav'ns of heav'ns him praise, and floods
      above the heavens' height.

      Let all the creatures praise the name
      of our almighty LORD:
      For he commanded, and they were
      created by his word.

      He also, for all times to come,
      hath them established sure;
      He hath appointed them a law,
      which ever shall endure.

      Praise ye JEHOVAH from the earth,
      dragons, and ev'ry deep:
      Fire, hail, snow, vapour, stormy wind,
      his word that fully keep.

      All hills and mountains, fruitful trees,
      and all ye cedars high:
      Beasts, and all cattle, creeping things,
      and all ye birds that fly.

      Kings of the earth, all nätions,
      princes, earth's judges all:
      Both young men, yea, and maidens too,
      old men, and children small.

      Let them GOD's name praise; for his name
      alone is excellent:
      His glory reacheth far above
      the earth and firmament.

      His people's horn, the praise of all
      his saints, exalteth he;
      Ev'n Isr'el's seed, a people near
      to him. The LORD praise ye.

      The LORD of heav'n confess,
      On high his glory raise.
      Him let all angels bless,
      Him all his armies praise.
      Him glorify sun, moon, and stars;
      Ye higher spheres, and cloudy sky.

      From GOD your beings are,
      Him therefore famous make;
      You all created were,
      When he the word but spake.
      And from that place, where fixed you be
      By his decree, you cannot pass.

      Praise GOD from earth below,
      Ye dragons, and ye deeps:
      Fire, hail, clouds, wind, and snow,
      Whom in command he keeps.
      Praise ye his name, hills great and small,
      Trees low and tall; beasts wild and tame;

      All things that creep or fly.
      Ye kings, ye vulgar throng,
      All princes mean or high;
      Both men and virgins young,
      Ev'n young and old, exalt his name;
      For much his fame should be extolled.

      O let GOD's name be praised
      Above both earth and sky;
      For he his saints hath raised,
      And set their horn on high;
      Ev'n those that be of Isr'el's race,
      Near to his grace.  The LORD praise ye.

    commentary:
      john_brown: >
        Here the psalmist, overwhelmed with enrapturing views of the glory,
        and a sense of the goodness of the Lord, issues forth a solemn call to
        all his fellow creatures, to assist him in his songs of praise. (1.)
        To the celestial creatures above, whether intellectual beings or not,
        ver. 1-6. (2.) To the terrestrial creatures below, whether irrational,
        ver. 7-10; or rational, ver. 11-13; but chiefly to his chosen people,
        ver. 14.<br/><br/><br/>While angels and other rational beings actively
        trumpet forth his honours, and irrational creatures praise him
        objectively, in manifesting his excellencies marked on them; let my
        soul be ravished with his glory, amazed with his grace, and all
        inflamed with love, in uttering his praise, who, in Christ, is my God,
        and my exceeding Joy. Cry out, all my powers, My God, who is like unto
        thee! Is there any work like unto thy work!

      Praise ye the LORD: unto him sing
      a new song, and his praise
      In the assembly of his saints
      in sweet psalms do ye raise.

      Let Isr'el in his Maker joy,
      and to him praises sing:
      Let all that Zion's children are
      be joyful in their King.

      O let them unto his great name
      give praises in the dance;
      Let them with timbrel and with harp
      in songs his praise advance.

      For GOD doth pleasure take in those
      that his own people be;
      And he with his salvätion
      the meek will beautify.

      And in his glory excellent
      let all his saints rejoice:
      Let them to him upon their beds
      aloud lift up their voice.

      Let in their mouth aloft be raised
      the high praise of the Lord,
      And let them have in their right hand
      a sharp two-edgèd sword;

      To execute the vengeance due
      upon the heathen all,
      And make deservèd punishment
      upon the people fall.

      And ev'n with chains, as pris'ners, bind
      their kings that them command;
      Yea, and with iron fetters strong,
      the nobles of their land.

      On them the judgment to perform
      found written in his word:
      This honour is to all his saints.
      O do ye praise the LORD.

    commentary:

        This psalm was perhaps penned by David, when he took the strong hold
        of Zion from the Jebusites; and represents, (1.) Abundant joys to the
        people of God, in his relation to, delight in, and kindness towards
        them, ver. 1-5. (2.) Abundance of terror to the proudest of their
        enemies, in their victory and power over them, ver.
        6-9.<br/><br/><br/>While I sing, let mine eyes be fixed on Jesus
        Christ, going forth in his chariots of salvation, subduing his enemies
        to himself, by the gospel rod of his strength, in the Apostolic and
        Millennial periods, Rev. 20:2; and in the chariots of vengeance,
        destroying his incorrigible opposers, by the iron rod of his wrath,
        and treading them under the feet of his saints.

        This psalm contains thirteen calls to praise God. It directs, (1.) Who

        that he dwells with men; and for his mighty acts, and his excellent
        greatness, ver. 1-2. (3.) How he ought to be praised, viz. in a
