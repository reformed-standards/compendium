      We confess and acknowledge one only God, to whom only we must cleave, whom only
      we must serve[a], whom only we must worship[b], and in whom only we put our
      trust[c]. Who is eternal, infinite, immeasurable, incomprehensible, omnipotent,
      invisible, one in substance and yet distinct in three persons, the Father, the
      Son, and the Holy Ghost[d]. By whom we confess and believe, all things in
      heaven and earth[e], as well visible as invisible, to have been created, to be
      retained in their being, and to be ruled and guided by His inscrutable
      providence, to such end as His eternal wisdom[f], goodness, and justice has
      appointed them to the manifestation of His own glory.

      We confess and acknowledge this our God to have created man (to wit, our first father
      Adam) to His own image and similitude[a]. To whom He gave wisdom, lordship, justice, free
      will, and clear knowledge of Himself. So that in the whole nature of man, there could be
      noted no imperfection. From which honor and perfection, man and woman did both
      fall[b], the woman being deceived by the Serpent, and man obeying the voice of
      the woman: both conspiring against the sovereign majesty of God, who in express
      words had before threatened death, if they presumed to eat of the forbidden
      tree.

    number: 3

      By which transgression, commonly called original sin, was the image of God
      utterly defaced in man. And he and his posterity of nature became enemies to
      God, slaves to Satan, and servants to sin[a], that death everlasting has had,
      and insofar will have, power and domination over all that have not been, are
      not, or will not be regenerated from above[b]. Which regeneration is wrought by
      the power of the Holy Ghost[c] working in the hearts of the elect of God, an
      assured faith in the promises of God revealed to us in His Word, by which faith
      they apprehend Christ Jesus with the graces and benefits promised in Him.

      For this we constantly believe that God, after the fearful and horrible
      defection of man from His obedience, did seek Adam again, call upon him, rebuke
      his sin[a], convict him of the same, and in the end made unto him a most joyful
      promise: to wit, that the seed of the woman should break down the Serpent’s
      head, that is, He should destroy the works of the devil. Which promise, as it
      was repeated and made more clear from time to time[b], so was it embraced with
      joy and most constantly retained of all the faithful from Adam to Noah, from
      Noah to Abraham, from Abraham to David, and so forth to the incarnation of
      Christ Jesus. Who all (we mean the faithful fathers) under the Law did
      see the joyful days of Christ Jesus and did rejoice.

    text: >
      We most constantly believe that God preserved, instructed, multiplied, honored,
      adorned[a], and from death called to life His kirk in all ages from Adam till
      the coming of Christ Jesus in the flesh. For Abraham, He called from his
      father’s country[b], him He instructed, his seed He multiplied[c], the same He
      marvelously preserved and more marvelously delivered from the bondage and
      tyranny of Pharaoh. To them He gave His laws[d], constitutions, and ceremonies.
      Them He possessed in the land of Canaan[e]: to them, after judges and after
      Saul, He gave David to be king[f], to whom He made promise that of the fruit of
      his loins should one sit forever upon His regal seat. To this same people, from
      time to time, He sent prophets to reduce them to the right way of their God[g],
      from which oftentimes they declined by idolatry[h]. And albeit that for their
      stubborn contempt of justice, He was compelled to give them into the hands of
      their enemies, as before was threatened by the mouth of Moses[i], in so much
      that the holy city was destroyed, the temple burnt with fire, and the whole
      land left desolate the space of 70 years[j], yet of mercy did He lead them
      again to Jerusalem. Where the city and temple were rebuilt and they against all
      temptations and assaults of Satan did abide, till the Messiah came according to
      the promise.

      When the fullness of time came[a], God sent His Son, His eternal wisdom, the
      substance of His own glory, into this world, who took the nature of manhood of
      the substance of a woman, to wit, of a virgin, and that by operation of the
      Holy Ghost[b], and so was born the just seed of David, the angel of the great
      counsel of God, the very Messiah promised[c]. Whom we acknowledge and confess,
      Immanuel, very God and very man, two perfect natures united and joined in one
      person. By which our confession, we condemn the damnable and pestilent heresies
      of Arius, Marcion, Eutyches, Nestorius, and such others, as either deny the
      eternity of His Godhead, or the verity of His human nature, or confounded them,
      or yet denied them.

    number: 8
    text: >
      For that same eternal God and Father, who of mere grace elected us in Christ
      Jesus His Son before the foundation of the world was laid[a], appointed Him to
      be our Head, our brother[b], our pastor, and great bishop of our souls[c]. But
      because the enmity betwixt the justice of God and our sins was such that no
      flesh by itself could or might have attained unto God, it behooved that the Son
      of God should descend unto us and take Himself a body of our body, flesh of our
      flesh, and bones of our bones: and so become the perfect mediator betwixt God
      and man, giving power to so many as believe in Him to be the sons of God[d]. As
      He Himself does witness, “I pass up to my Father and unto your Father, to my
      God and unto your God”[e]. By which most holy fraternity, whatsoever we have
      lost in Adam is restored to us again. And for this cause are we not afraid to
      call God our Father, not so much that He has created us (which we have common with the reprobate)
      as for that, that He has given to us His only Son, to be our brother, and given unto us grace to
      acknowledge and embrace Him for our only mediator, as before was said. It
      behooved further the Messiah and Redeemer to be very God and very man because
      He was to undergo the punishment due for our transgressions[f], and to present
      Himself in the presence of His Father’s judgment as in our person to suffer for
      our transgression and disobedience by death, to overcome him that was author of
      death. But because the only Godhead could not suffer death, neither yet could
      the only manhood overcome the same, He joined both together in one person that
      the weakness of the one should suffer and be subject to death (which we had deserved), and the
      infinite and invincible power of the other, to wit, of the Godhead, should
      triumph and purchase to us life, liberty, and perpetual victory. And so we
      confess and most undoubtedly believe.

      That our Lord Jesus offered Himself a voluntary sacrifice unto His Father for
      us[a], that He suffered contradiction of sinners, that He was wounded and
      plagued for our transgressions[b], that He being the clean and innocent Lamb of
      God was damned in the presence of an earthly judge, that we should be absolved
      before the tribunal seat of our God. That He suffered not only the cruel death
      of the cross (which was accursed by the sentence of God [Deut. 21; Gal. 3]),
      but also that He suffered for a season the wrath of His Father, which sinners
      had deserved. But yet we avow that He remained the only well beloved and
      blessed Son of His Father, even in the midst of His anguish and torment which
      He suffered in body and soul to make that full satisfaction for the sins of His
      people[c]. After which we confess and avow that there remains no other
      sacrifice for sin, which if any affirm, we nothing doubt to avow that they are
      blasphemous against Christ’s death and the everlasting purgation and
      satisfaction purchased to us by the same.

      We undoubtedly believe that in as much as it was impossible that the sorrows of
      death should retain in bondage the author of life[a], that our Lord Jesus,
      crucified, died, and buried[b], who descended into hell, did rise again for our
      justification, and destroying him who was author of death brought life again
      unto us that were subject to death and to the bondage of the same. We know that
      His resurrection was confirmed by the testimony of His very enemies[c], by the
      resurrection of the dead whose sepulchers did open and they did arise and
      appeared to many within the city of Jerusalem[d]. It was also confirmed by the
      testimony of angels and by the senses and judgments of His apostles and of
      others[e], who had conversation and did eat and drink with Him after His
      resurrection.

    number: 11
    text: >
      We nothing doubt but that the same self body which was born of the virgin, was
      crucified, and buried, and which did rise again, did ascend into the
      heavens[a], for the accomplishment of all things where in our names and for our
      comfort, He has received all power in heaven and earth[b], where He sits at the
      right hand of the Father[c], inaugurating His kingdom, advocate and only
      mediator for us[d]. Which glory, honor, and prerogative, He alone amongst the
      brethren will possess till all His enemies are made His footstool, as that we
      undoubtedly believe they will be in the final judgment: to the execution
      whereof we certainly believe that the same Lord Jesus will visibly return as He
      was seen to ascend[e]. And then we firmly believe that the time of refreshing
      and restitution of all things will come[f], in so much that those who from the
      beginning have suffered violence, injury, and wrong for righteousness sake will
      inherit that blessed immortality promised from the beginning. But contrariwise
      the stubborn, disobedient, cruel oppressors, filthy persons, idolaters, and all
      sorts of unfaithful[g] will be cast in the dungeon of utter darkness, where
      their worm will not die, neither yet their fire be extinguished. The
      remembrance of which day and of the judgment to be executed in the same is not
      only to us a bridle whereby our carnal lusts are restrained, but also such
      inestimable comfort that neither may the threatening of worldly princes,
      neither yet the fear of temporal death and present danger move us to renounce
      and forsake that blessed society which we the members have with our Head and
      only Mediator, Christ Jesus. Whom we confess and avow to be the Messiah
      promised, the only Head of His kirk, our just Lawgiver, our only High Priest,
      Advocate and Mediator[h]. In which honors and offices, if man or angel presumes
      to intrude themselves, we utterly detest and abhor them as blasphemous to our
      sovereign and supreme governor Christ Jesus.

      This our faith and the assurance of the same proceeds not from flesh and
      blood[a], that is to say, from no natural powers within us, but is the
      inspiration of the Holy Ghost[b], whom we confess God equal with the Father and
      with the Son, who sanctifies us and brings us in all verity by His own
      operation, without whom we should remain forever enemies to God and ignorant of
      His Son, Christ Jesus. For by nature we are so dead, so blind, and so perverse
      that neither can we feel when we are pricked, see the light when it shines, nor
      assent to the will of God when it is revealed, unless the Spirit of the Lord
      Jesus quicken that which is dead, remove the darkness from our minds, and bow
      our stubborn hearts to the obedience of His blessed will. And so as we confess
      that God the Father created us when we were not; as His Son our Lord Jesus
      redeemed us when we were enemies to Him[c]; so also do we confess that the Holy
      Ghost does sanctify and regenerate us without all respect of any merit
      proceeding from us, be it before or be it after our regeneration. To speak this
      one thing, yet in more plain words, as we willingly spoil our selves of all
      honor and glory of our own creation and redemption, so do we also of our
      regeneration and sanctification, for of our selves we are not sufficient to
      think any good thought[d]. But He who has begun the good work in us is only He
      that continues us in the same to the praise and glory of His undeserved grace.

    number: 13
    text: >
      So that the cause of good works we confess to be not our free will, but the
      Spirit of the Lord Jesus[a], who dwelling in our hearts by true faith brings
      forth such good works as God has prepared for us to walk in. For this we most
      boldly affirm, that it is blasphemy to say that Christ Jesus abides in the
      heart of those in whom is no spirit of sanctification. And, therefore, we fear
      not to affirm that murderers, oppressors, cruel persecutors, adulterers,
      whoremongers, filthy persons, idolaters, drunkards, thieves, and all workers of
      iniquity have neither true faith nor any portion of the Spirit of the Lord
      Jesus so long as they obstinately continue in their wickedness. For how soon
      that ever the Spirit of the Lord Jesus (which God’s elect children receive by
      true faith) takes possession in the heart of any man, so soon does He
      regenerate and renew the same man so that he begins to hate that which before
      he loved and begins to love that which before he hated. And from thence comes
      that continual battle which is betwixt the flesh and the spirit in God’s
      children. While flesh and the natural man (according to their own corruption)
      lusts for things pleasing and
      delectable unto the self[b], grudges in adversity, is lifted up in prosperity,
      and at every moment is prone and ready to offend the majesty of God. But the
      Spirit of God, who gives witness to our spirit that we are the sons of God[c],
      makes us to resist the devil, to abhor filthy pleasures, to groan in God’s
      presence for deliverance from this bondage of corruption, and finally to
      triumph over sin that it reign not in our mortal bodies. This battle has not
      the carnal man being destitute of God’s Spirit: but do follow and obey sin with
      greediness and without repentance, even as the devil and their corrupt lusts do
      prick them. But the sons of God (as was before said), do fight against sin, do sob and mourn when
      they perceive themselves tempted to iniquity; and if they fall, they rise again
      with earnest and unfeigned repentance, and these things they do not by their
      own power, but by the power of the Lord Jesus without whom they were able to do
      nothing[d].

    number: 14
    text: >
      We confess and acknowledge that God has given to man His holy law[a] in which
      not only are forbidden all such works as displease and offend His godly
      majesty, but also are commanded all such as please Him and as He has promised
      to reward. And these works be of two sorts. The one are done to the honor of
      God; the other to the profit of our neighbors; and both have the revealed will
      of God for their assurance. To have one God, to worship and honor Him, to call
      upon Him in all our troubles, reverence His holy name, to hear His Word, to
      believe the same, to communicate with His holy sacraments are the works of the
      first table. To honor father and mother[b], princes, rulers and superior
      powers[c], to love them, to support them, yes to obey their charges (not repugnant to the commandments of
      God), to save
      the lives of innocents[d], to repress tyranny[e], to defend the oppressed[f],
      to keep our bodies clean and holy[g], to live in sobriety and temperance[h], to
      deal justly with all men both in word and deed, and finally to repress all
      appetite of our neighbor’s hurt, are the good works of the second table which
      are most pleasing and acceptable unto God as those works that are commanded by
      Himself. The contrary of which is sin most odious which always displeases Him
      and provokes Him to anger[i]. As not to call upon Him alone when we have need,
      not to hear His Word with reverence, to condemn and despise it, to have or to
      worship idols, to maintain and defend idolatry, lightly to esteem the revered
      name of God, to profane, abuse, or condemn the sacraments of Christ Jesus, to
      disobey or resist any that God has placed in authority (while they pass not over the
      bounds of their office)[j], to murder, to
      consent thereto, to bear hatred or to suffer innocent blood to be shed, if we
      may withstand it[k], and finally the transgression of any other commandment in
      the first or second table, we confess and affirm to be sin by which God’s hot
      displeasure is kindled against the proud and unthankful world.

    number: 15
    text: >
      The Law of God we confess and acknowledge most just, most equal, most holy, and
      most perfect[a], commanding those things which being wrought in perfection were
      able to give life and to bring man to eternal felicity[b]. But our nature is so
      corrupt, so weak, and so imperfect[c] that we are never able to fulfill the
      works of the Law in perfection. Yes, if we say we have no sin (even after we are regenerate)[d], we deceive
      ourselves and the verity of God is not in us. And, therefore, it behooves us to
      apprehend Christ Jesus with His justice and satisfaction, who is the end and
      accomplishment of the Law[e], by whom we are set at this liberty[f] that the
      curse and malediction of the Law[g] fall not upon us, albeit we fulfill not the
      same in all points[h]. For God the Father beholding us in the body of His Son
      Christ Jesus, accepts our imperfect obedience as it were perfect, and covers
      our works, which are defiled with many spots, with the justice of His Son. We
      do not mean that we are set so at liberty that we owe no obedience to the
      Law (for that before we have plainly confessed). But this we
      affirm that no man in earth (Christ Jesus only excepted) has given, gives, or will
      give in work that obedience to the Law which the Law requires[i]. But when we
      have done all things, we must fall down and unfeignedly confess that we are
      unprofitable servants. And, therefore, whosoever boast themselves of the merits
      of their own works or put their trust in the works of supererogation boast
      themselves of that which is not, and put their trust in damnable idolatry.

      As we believe in one God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, so we must constantly
      believe that from the beginning there has been, now is and to the end of the
      world will be[a], a kirk, that is to say, one company and multitude of men
      chosen of God[b], who rightly worship and embrace Him by true faith in Christ
      Jesus, who is the only head of the same kirk, which also is the body and spouse
      of Christ Jesus[c]. Which kirk is catholic, that is universal, because it
      contains the elect of all ages, all realms, nations, and tongues[d] be they of
      the Jews or be they of the Gentiles; who have communion and society with God
      the Father and with His Son Christ Jesus, through the sanctification of His
      Holy Spirit, and, therefore, is it called the communion (not of profane persons) but of saints, who
      as citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem[e] have the fruition of the most
      inestimable benefits, to wit, of one God, one Lord Jesus, one faith, and of one
      baptism, out of which kirk there is neither life nor eternal felicity. And,
      therefore, we utterly abhor the blasphemy of those that affirm that men, who
      live according to equity and justice, will be saved whatsoever religion they
      have professed. For as without Christ Jesus there is neither life nor
      salvation, so will none be participant thereof, but such as the Father has
      given unto His Son Christ Jesus[f], and those in time come unto Him, avow His
      doctrine and believe in Him (we comprehend the children with the faithful parents).
      This kirk is invisible, known only to God who alone knows it, whom He has
      chosen, and comprehends as well (as is said) the elect that be departed (commonly
      called the kirk triumphant) as those that yet live and fight against sin and Satan as will
      live hereafter.

      The elect departed are in peace and rest from their labors[a], not that they
      will sleep and come to any certain oblivion (as some fanatics do affirm), but they are delivered from all
      fear, all torment, and all temptation to which we and all God’s elect are
      subject in this life[b], and, therefore, do bear the name of the kirk militant.
      As contrariwise the reprobate and unfaithful departed have anguish, torment,
      and pain that cannot be expressed. So that neither are the one nor the other in
      such sleep that they feel not joy or torment as the parable of Christ in the
      sixteenth of Luke, His words to the thief and these words of the souls crying
      under the altar, “O Lord thou that are righteous and just, how long will thou
      not revenge our blood upon those that dwell on the earth?”

      Because that Satan from the beginning has labored to deck his pestilent
      synagogue with the title of the kirk of God and has inflamed the hearts of
      cruel murderers to persecute, trouble and molest the true kirk and members
      thereof, as Cain did Abel, Ishmael Isaac, Esau Jacob[a], and the whole
      priesthood of the Jews, Christ Jesus Himself and His apostles after Him[b], it
      is one thing most requisite that the true kirk be discerned from the filthy
      synagogue by clear and perfect notes, lest we being deceived receive and
      embrace to our own condemnation the one for the other. The notes, signs, and
      assured tokens by which the immaculate spouse of Christ Jesus is known from
      that horrible harlot, the kirk malignant, we affirm are neither antiquity,
      title usurped, lineal descent, place appointed, nor multitude of men approving
      any error. For Cain in age and title was preferred to Abel and Seth. Jerusalem
      had prerogative above all places of the earth, where also were the priests
      lineally descended from Aaron, and a greater multitude followed the scribes and
      Pharisees and priests than unfeignedly believed and approved Christ Jesus and
      His doctrine. And yet as we suppose no man (of whole judgment) will grant that any of the
      forenamed were the kirk of God. The notes, therefore, of the true kirk of God,
      we believe, confess and avow to be first, the true preaching of the Word of
      God, in which God has revealed Himself to us[c] as the writings of the prophets
      and apostles do declare. Secondly, the right administration of the sacraments
      of Christ Jesus must be annexed unto the Word and promises of God to seal and
      confirm the same in our hearts. Last, ecclesiastical discipline[d], uprightly
      ministered as God’s Word prescribes whereby vice is reproved and virtue
      nourished[e]. Wheresoever then these former notes are seen and of any time
      continue (be the number never so few, about two or three), there without
      all doubt is the true kirk of Christ, who according
      to His promise is in the midst of them: not that universal (of which we have before spoken) but particular,
      such as was in Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, and other places[f] in which the
      ministry was planted by Paul and were of himself named the kirks of God. And
      such kirks we the inhabitants of the realm of Scotland, professors of Christ
      Jesus, confess ourselves to have in our cities, towns, and places reformed. For
      the doctrine taught in our kirks is contained in the written Word of God, to
      wit, in the books of the New and Old Testaments. In those books we mean which
      of the ancient have been reputed canonical in the which we affirm that all
      things necessary to be believed for the salvation of mankind is sufficiently
      expressed[f], the interpretation whereof we confess neither appertains to
      private nor public persons, neither yet to any kirk for any preeminence or
      prerogative personal or local which one has above another, but appertains to
      the Spirit of God by which also the Scripture was written.

      When controversy then happens, for the right understanding of any place or
      sentence of Scripture or for the reformation of any abuse within the kirk of
      God, we ought not so much to look at what men before us have said or done, as
      unto that which the Holy Ghost uniformly speaks within the body of the
      Scriptures, and unto that which Christ Jesus Himself did and commanded to be
      done[g]. For this is a thing universally granted, that the Spirit of
      God (which is the spirit of unity) is in nothing contrary unto Himself. If then
      the interpretation, determination or sentence of any doctor, kirk or council,
      repugnant to the plain Word of God written in any other place of Scripture, it
      is a thing most certain that there is not the true understanding and meaning of
      the Holy Ghost, supposing that councils, realms, and nations have approved and
      received the same. For we dare not receive nor admit any interpretation which is
      directly repugnant to any principal point of our faith, to any other plain text
      of Scripture or yet unto the rule of charity.

      to be of God and neither to depend on men nor angels. We affirm, therefore,
      that such as allege the Scripture to have no authority but that which it
      receives from the kirk, to be blasphemous against God and injurious to the true
      kirk which always hears and obeys the voice of her own spouse and pastor[b],

      As we do not rashly damn that which godly men assembled together in general
      councils lawfully gathered have propounded unto us, so without just examination
      dare we not receive whatsoever is forced upon men under the name of general
      councils. For plain it is that as they were men so have some of them manifestly
      erred and that in matters of great weight and importance. So far then as the
      council proves the determination and commandment that it gives by the plain
      Word of God, so far do we reverence and embrace the same. But if men under the
      name of a council pretend to forge unto us new articles of our faith or to make
      constitutions repugnant to the Word of God, then utterly we must refuse the
      same as the doctrine of devils which draw our souls from the voice of our only
      God to follow the doctrines and constitutions of men[a]. The cause then why
      general councils convened was neither to make any perpetual law (which God before had not made) neither yet
      to forge new articles of our belief, neither to give the Word of God authority,
      much less to make that to be His Word or yet the true interpretation of the
      same which was not before by His holy will expressed in His Word. But the cause
      of councils (we mean of such as merit the name of councils) was
      partly for confutation of heresies and for giving public
      confession of their faith to the posterity following which both they did by the
      authority of God’s written Word and not by any opinion or prerogative that they
      could not err by reason of their general assembly. And this we judge to have
      been the chief cause of general councils. The other was for good policy and
      order to be constituted and observed in the kirk, in which (as in the house of God) it becomes all
      things to be done decently and in order[b]. Not that we think that one policy
      and one order in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times, and places:
      for as ceremonies (such as man has devised) are but temporal so may and ought they to be changed when
      they rather foster superstition than that they edify the kirk using the same.

      As the fathers under the Law (besides the verity of the sacrifices) had two chief sacraments, to wit, circumcision
      and the Passover, the despisers and contemners whereof were not reputed for
      God’s people[a], so we do acknowledge and confess that we now in the time of
      the gospel have two sacraments only, instituted by the Lord Jesus and commanded
      to be used of all those that will be reputed members of His body[b], to wit,
      baptism and the Supper or table of the Lord Jesus called the communion of His
      body and blood. And these sacraments (as well of the Old as of the New Testament)
      were instituted of God, not only to
      make a visible difference betwixt His people and those that were without His
      league, but also to exercise the faith of His children and by participation of
      the same sacraments to seal in their hearts the assurance of His promises and
      of that most blessed conjunction, union and society which the elect have with
      their head, Christ Jesus.

      And thus we utterly damn the vanity of those that affirm sacraments to be
      nothing else but naked and bare signs[c]. No, we assuredly believe that by
      baptism we are engrafted in Christ Jesus to be made partakers of His justice by
      which our sins are covered and remitted[d]. And also that in the Supper
      rightly used, Christ Jesus is so joined with us[e] that He becomes the
      very nourishment and food of our souls. Not that we imagine any
      transubstantiation of bread in Christ’s natural body and of wine in His natural
      blood (as the papists have perniciously taught and damnably believe), but this
      union and conjunction which we have with the body and blood of Christ Jesus in
      the right use of the sacraments is wrought by operation of the Holy Ghost, who
      by true faith carries us above all things that are visible, carnal, and earthly,
      and makes us to feed upon the body and blood of Christ Jesus which was once
      broken and shed for us which now is in heaven[f] and appears in the
      presence of His Father for us; and yet notwithstanding the far distance of the
      place which is betwixt His body now glorified in heaven and us now mortal in
      this earth, yet we most assuredly believe that the bread that we break is the
      communion of Christ’s body[g], and the cup which we bless is the
      communion of His blood. So that we confess and undoubtedly believe that the
      faithful, in the right use of the Lord’s table do so eat the body and drink the
      blood of the Lord Jesus[h] that He remains in them and they in Him, yes
      that they are so made flesh of His flesh and bone of His bones that as the
      eternal Godhead has given to the flesh of Christ Jesus (which of its own
      condition and nature was mortal and corruptible) life and immortality[i],
      so does Christ Jesus, His flesh and blood eaten and drunk by us, give to us the
      same prerogatives[j]. Which albeit we confess are neither given unto us at
      that only time neither yet by the proper power and virtue of the sacrament only,
      yet we affirm that the faithful in the right use of the Lord’s table have such
      conjunction with Christ Jesus as the natural man can not apprehend. Yes and
      farther we affirm that albeit the faithful oppressed by negligence and manly
      infirmity do not profit so much as they would in the very instant action of the
      Supper, yet will it after bring forth fruit as lively seed sown in good
      ground. For the Holy Spirit (which can never be divided from the right
      institution of the Lord Jesus) will not frustrate the faithful of the fruit of
      that mystical action, but all this we say comes by true faith which apprehends
      Christ Jesus who only makes His sacrament effectual unto us. And, therefore,
      whosoever slanders us, as that we affirmed or believed sacraments to be only
      naked and bare signs, do injury unto us and speak against a manifest truth. But
      this liberally and frankly we must confess, that we make a distinction betwixt
      Christ Jesus in His natural substance and betwixt the elements in the
      sacramental signs. So that we will neither worship the signs in place of that
      which is signified by them, neither yet do we despise and interpret them as
      unprofitable and vain, but do use them with all reverence, examining ourselves
      diligently before, that so we do because we are assured by the mouth of the
      apostle that such as eat of the bread and drink of that cup unworthily are
      guilty of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus[k].

      That sacraments be rightly ministered, we judge two things requisite: the one,
      that they be ministered by lawful ministers whom we affirm to be only they that
      are appointed to the preaching of the Word or unto whose mouths God has put
      some sermon of exhortation, they being men lawfully chosen thereto by some
      kirk. The other, that they be ministered in such elements and in such sort as
      God has appointed. Else we affirm that they cease to be right sacraments of
      Christ Jesus. And therefore it is that we flee the society with the papistical
      kirk in participation of their sacraments. First, because their ministers are
      not ministers of Christ Jesus[a]; (yes, which is more horrible) they suffer women, whom the Holy Ghost
      will not suffer, to teach in the congregation [and] to baptize. And secondly,
      because they have so adulterated both the one sacrament and the other with
      their own inventions that no part of Christ’s action abides in the original
      purity. For oil, salt, spittle, and such like in baptism are but men’s
      inventions, adoration, veneration, bearing through streets and towns and
      keeping of bread in boxes or buists [small boxes] are profanation of Christ’s
      sacraments and no use of the same. For Christ Jesus said, “Take and eat. Do ye
      this in remembrance of me”[b]. By which words and charge He sanctified bread
      and wine to be the sacrament of His body and blood to the end that the one
      should be eaten and that all should drink of the other; and not that they
      should be kept to be worshipped and honored as God, as the papists have done
      heretofore, who also have committed sacrilege, stealing from the people the one
      part of the sacrament, to wit, the blessed cup. Moreover that the sacraments
      are rightly used, it is requisite that the end and cause why the sacraments
      were instituted be understood and observed, as well of the minister as the
      receivers. For if the opinion be changed in the receiver, the right use ceases
      which is most evident by the rejection of the sacrifices as also if the teacher
      plainly teaches false doctrine[c], which were odious and abominable unto God
      (albeit they were His own ordinance)
      because that wicked men used them to one other end than God had ordained. The
      same affirm we of the sacraments[e] in the papistical kirk in which we affirm
      the whole action of the Lord Jesus to be adulterated, as well in the external
      form as in the end and opinion. What Christ Jesus did and commanded to be done
      is evident by three evangelists[f] and by St. Paul[g]. What the priest does at
      his altar we need not rehearse. The end and cause of Christ’s institution and
      why the selfsame should be used is expressed in these words: “Do ye this in
      remembrance of Me. As often as ever ye will eat of this bread and drink of this
      cup, ye will show forth (that is, extol, preach, magnify, and praise)
      the Lord’s death till He come.” But to what end and
      in what opinion the priests say their Masses, let the words of the same, their
      own doctors and writings witness. To wit, that they as mediators betwixt Christ
      and His kirk do offer unto God the Father a sacrifice propitiatory for the sins
      of the quick and the dead. Which doctrine as blasphemous to Christ Jesus and
      making derogation to the sufficiency of His only sacrifice once offered for
      purgation of all those that will be sanctified, we utterly abhor, detest, and
      renounce.

      faith and understanding. But the Supper of the Lord, we confess to appertain to
      such only as be of the household of faith, can try and examine themselves as
      well in their faith as in their duty towards their neighbors. Such as eat and
      drink at that holy table without faith or being at dissension and disunion with
      their brethren do eat unworthily. And, therefore, it is that in our kirks our
      ministers take public and particular examination of the knowledge and

      Albeit that the Word of God truly preached, the sacraments rightly ministered
      and discipline executed according to the Word of God, be the certain and
      infallible signs of the true kirk, yet do we not so mean that every particular
      person joined with such a company is an elect member of Christ Jesus. For we
      acknowledge and confess that darnel, cockle, and chaff may be sown, grow and in
      great abundance lie in the midst of the wheat[a], that is, the reprobate may be
      joined in the society of the elect and may externally use with them the
      benefits of the Word and sacraments; but such being but temporal professors in
      mouth, but not in heart, do fall back and continue not to the end. And,
      therefore, have they no fruit of Christ’s death, resurrection, nor ascension;
      but such as whose heart unfeignedly believe[b] and whose mouth boldly confess
      the Lord Jesus (as before we have said) will most assuredly receive these gifts first in this life,
      remission of sins, and that by only faith in Christ’s blood[c], in so much that
      albeit sin remains and continually abides in these our mortal bodies, yet is it
      not imputed unto us, but is remitted and covered with Christ’s justice.
      Secondarily, in the general judgment there will be given to every man and woman
      resurrection of the flesh[d]; for the sea will give up her dead, the earth
      those that therein be enclosed: yes, our eternal God will stretch out His hand
      upon the dust and the dead will arise incorruptible and that in the substance
      of the self same flesh that every man now bears, to receive according to their
      works, glory, or punishment[e]. For such as now dealt in vanity, cruelty,
      filthiness, superstition, or idolatry will be adjudged to that fire
      inextinguishable in which they will be committed for ever[f], as well in their
      own bodies as in their souls which now they give to serve the devil in all
      abomination. But such as continue in well doing to the end, boldly professing

      immortality to reign forever in life everlasting with Christ Jesus, to whose
      glorified body all His elect will be made like[g], when He will appear again to
      judgment and will render up the kingdom to God His Father, who then will be and
      ever will remain all in all things[h], God blessed forever. To whom with the
