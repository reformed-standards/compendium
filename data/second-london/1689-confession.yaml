          The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule
          of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, although the light of nature,
          and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness,
          wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are they not
          sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is necessary
          unto salvation. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers
          manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church;
          and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and
          for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption
          of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same
          wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary,
          those former ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now
          ceased.

          The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are
          no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no
          authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made
          use of than other human writings.

          The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed,
          dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God
          (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received
          because it is the Word of God.

          We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to an
          high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of
          the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style,
          the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all
          glory to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation,
          and many other incomparable excellencies, and entire perfections thereof,
          are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word
          of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
          truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy
          Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.

          The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory,
          man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily
          contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be
          added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men. Nevertheless,
          we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary
          for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word,
          and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and
          government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are
          to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence, according to
          the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.

          All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear
          unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed and
          observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place
          of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in
          a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of
          them.

          The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
          of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the
          writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately
          inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all
          ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of religion, the
          church is finally to appeal to them. But because these original tongues
          are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest
          in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search
          them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every
          nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in
          all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience
          and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.

          The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself;
          and therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of
          any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched by other
          places that speak more clearly.

          Such of the elect as are converted at riper years, having sometime lived
          in the state of nature, and therein served divers lusts and pleasures, God
          in their effectual calling giveth them repentance unto life.

          may, through the power and deceitfulness of their corruption dwelling in
          them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great sins and provocations;
          God hath, in the covenant of grace, mercifully provided that believers so
          sinning and falling be renewed through repentance unto salvation.

          by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils of his sin, doth,

          of it, and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon and strength of grace, with

          themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of, humiliation
          for, and hatred against, sin; together with a clearer sight of the need
          they have of Christ and the perfection of his obedience; it is likewise
          of use to the regenerate to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids
          sin; and the threatenings of it serve to shew what even their sins deserve,
          and what afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed
          from the curse and unallayed rigour thereof. The promises of it likewise
          shew them God's approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect
          upon the performance thereof, though not as due to them by the law as a
          covenant of works; so as man's doing good and refraining from evil, because
          the law encourageth to the one and deterreth from the other, is no evidence
          of his being under the law and not under grace.

          The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the gospel,
          consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of
          God, the rigour and curse of the law, and in their being delivered from
          this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin, from the
          evil of afflictions, the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave,
          and ever- lasting damnation: as also in their free access to God, and their
          yielding obedience unto Him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love
          and willing mind.  All which were common also to believers under the law
          for the substance of them; but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians
          is further enlarged, in their freedom from the yoke of a ceremonial law,
          to which the Jewish church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access
          to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit
          of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily partake of.

          by consecration of a priest, or by any other way, is repugnant not to Scripture
          alone, but even to common sense and reason, overthroweth the nature of the
          ordinance, and hath been, and is, the cause of manifold superstitions, yea,
          of gross idolatries.

          Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this ordinance,
          do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and
          corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and
          all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ being then not
          corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers
          in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.

          All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with
          Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table, and cannot, without great
          sin against him, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries,
          or be admitted thereunto; yea, whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty
          of the body and blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.

          The bodies of men after death return to dust, and see corruption; but their
          souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately
          return to God who gave them. The souls of the righteous being then made
          perfect in holiness, are received into paradise, where they are with Christ,
          and behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption
          of their bodies; and the souls of the wicked are cast into hell; where they
          remain in torment and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great
          day; besides these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the
          Scripture acknowledgeth none.

          God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness,

          all persons that have lived upon the earth shall appear before the tribunal
          of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to
          receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.

          fulness of joy and glory with everlasting rewards, in the presence of the

          As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a
          day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation
          of the godly in their adversity, so will he have the day unknown to men,
          that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because
          they know not at what hour the Lord will come, and may ever be prepared
          to say, Come Lord Jesus; come quickly . Amen.
