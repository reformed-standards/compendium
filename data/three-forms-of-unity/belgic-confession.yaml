  - name: That there is One Only God.
    number: 1
    text: >
      We all believe with the heart, and confess with the mouth, that there is
      one only simple and spiritual Being, which we call God; and that he is
      eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty,
      perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good.

  - name: By what means God is made known unto us.
    number: 2
    text: >
      We know him by two means: first, by the creation, preservation and
      government of the universe; which is before our eyes as a most elegant
      book, wherein all creatures, great and small, are as so many characters
      leading us to contemplate the invisible things of God, namely, his power
      and divinity, as the apostle Paul saith, Romans 1:20. All which things
      are sufficient to convince men, and leave them without excuse. Secondly,
      he makes himself more clearly and fully known to us by his holy and
      divine Word, that is to say, as far as is necessary for us to know in
      this life, to his glory and our salvation.

  - name: Of the written Word of God.
    number: 3
    text: >
      We confess that this Word of God was not sent, nor delivered by the will
      of man, but that holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
      Ghost, as the apostle Peter saith. And that afterwards God, from a
      special care, which he has for us and our salvation, commanded his
      servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit his revealed word to
      writing; and he himself wrote with his own finger, the two tables of the
      law. Therefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures.

  - name: Canonical Books of the Holy Scripture.
    number: 4
    text: >
      We believe that the Holy Scriptures are contained in two books, namely,
      the Old and New Testament, which are canonical, against which nothing
      can be alleged. These are thus named in the Church of God. The books of
      the Old Testament are, the five books of Moses, namely: Genesis, Exodus,
      Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the books of Joshua, Ruth, Judges, the
      two books of Samuel, the two of the Kings, two books of the Chronicles,
      commonly called Paralipomenon, the first of Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job,
      the Psalms of David, the three books of Solomon, namely, the Proverbs,
      Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs; the four great prophets Isaiah,
      Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel; and the twelve lesser prophets, namely,
      Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah,
      Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

      Those of the New Testament are the four evangelists, namely: Matthew,
      Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen epistles of
      the apostle Paul, namely: one to the Romans, two to the Corinthians, one
      to the Galatians, one to the Ephesians, one to the Philippians, one to
      the Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, two to Timothy, one to Titus,
      one to Philemon, and one to the Hebrews; the seven epistles of the other
      apostles, namely, one of James, two of Peter, three of John, one of
      Jude; and the Revelation of the apostle John.

  - name: From whence the Holy Scriptures derive their dignity and authority.
    number: 5
    text: >
      We receive all these books, and these only, as holy and canonical, for
      the regulation, foundation, and confirmation of our faith; believing
      without any doubt, all things contained in them, not so much because the
      Church receives and approves them as such, but more especially because
      the Holy Ghost witnesseth in our hearts, that they are from God, whereof
      they carry the evidence in themselves. For the very blind are able to
      perceive that the things foretold in them are fulfilling.

  - name: The difference between the canonical and apocryphal books.
    number: 6
    text: >
      We distinguish those sacred books from the apocryphal, namely: the third
      book of Esdras, the books of Tobias, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus Syrach,
      Baruch, the appendix to the book of Esther, the Song of the three
      Children in the Furnace, the history of Susannah, of Bell and the
      Dragon, the prayer of Manasses, and the two books of the Maccabees. All
      of which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they
      agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power
      and efficacy, as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of
      faith, or of the Christian religion; much less detract from the
      authority of the other sacred books.

  - name: The sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures, to be the only rule of faith.
    number: 7
    text: >
      We believe that those Holy Scriptures fully contain the will of God, and
      that whatsoever man ought to believe, unto salvation, is sufficiently
      taught therein. For, since the whole manner of worship, which God
      requires of us, is written in them at large, it is unlawful for any one,
      though an apostle, to teach otherwise than we are now taught in the Holy
      Scriptures: nay, though it were an angel from heaven, as the apostle
      Paul saith. For, since it is forbidden, to add unto or take away
      anything from the word of God, it doth thereby evidently appear, that
      the doctrine thereof is most perfect and complete in all respects.
      Neither do we consider of equal value any writing of men, however holy
      these men may have been, with those divine Scriptures, nor ought we to
      consider custom, or the great multitude, or antiquity, or succession of
      times and persons, or councils, decrees or statutes, as of equal value
      with the truth of God, for the truth is above all; for all men are of
      themselves liars, and more vain than vanity itself. Therefore, we reject
      with all our hearts, whatsoever doth not agree with this infallible
      rule, which the apostles have taught us, saying, Try the spirits whether
      they are of God. Likewise, if there come any unto you, and bring not
      this doctrine, receive him not into your house.

  - name: That God is one in Essence, yet nevertheless distinguished in three Persons.
    number: 8
    text: >
      According to this truth and this Word of God, we believe in one only
      God, who is the one single essence, in which are three persons, really,
      truly, and eternally distinct, according to their incommunicable
      properties; namely, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The
      Father is the cause, origin and beginning of all things visible and
      invisible; the Son is the word, wisdom, and image of the Father; the
      Holy Ghost is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father
      and the Son. Nevertheless God is not by this distinction divided into
      three, since the Holy Scriptures teach us, that the Father, and the Son,
      and the Holy Ghost, have each his personality, distinguished by their
      properties; but in such wise that these three persons are but one only
      God. Hence then, it is evident, that the Father is not the Son, nor the
      Son the Father, and likewise the Holy Ghost is neither the Father nor
      the Son. Nevertheless these persons thus distinguished are not divided,
      nor intermixed: for the Father hath not assumed the flesh, nor hath the
      Holy Ghost, but the Son only. The Father hath never been without his
      Son, or without his Holy Ghost. For they are all three co-eternal and
      co-essential. There is neither first nor last: for they are all three
      one, in truth, in power, in goodness, and in mercy.

  - name: The proof of the foregoing article of the Trinity of persons in one God.
    number: 9
    text: >
      All this we know, as well from the testimonies of holy writ, as from their
      operations, and chiefly by those we feel in ourselves. The testimonies of the
      Holy Scriptures, that teach us to believe this Holy Trinity are written in many
      places of the Old Testament, which are not so necessary to enumerate, as to
      choose them out with discretion and judgment. In Genesis, chapter 1:26, 27, God
      saith: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, etc. So God created
      man in his own image, male and female created he them. And Genesis 3:22. Behold
      the man is become as one of us. From this saying, let us make man in our image,
      it appears that there are more persons than one in the Godhead; and when he
      saith, God created, he signifies the unity. It is true that he doth not say how
      many persons there are, but that, which appears to us somewhat obscure in the
      Old Testament, is very plain in the New. For when our Lord was baptized in
      Jordan, the voice of the Father was heard, saying, This is my beloved Son: the
      Son was seen in the water, and the Holy Ghost appeared in the shape of a dove.
      This form is also instituted by Christ in the baptism of all believers. Baptize
      all nations, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
      In the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel thus addressed Mary, the mother of our
      Lord, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
      overshadow thee, therefore also that holy thing, which shall be born of thee,
      shall be called the Son of God: likewise, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you. And there
      are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost,
      and these three are one. In all which places we are fully taught, that there
      are three persons in one only divine essence. And although this doctrine far
      surpasses all human understanding, nevertheless, we now believe it by means of
      the Word of God, but expect hereafter to enjoy the perfect knowledge and
      benefit thereof in Heaven. Moreover, we must observe the particular offices and
      operations of these three persons toward us. The Father is called our Creator,
      by his power; the Son is our Savior and Redeemer, by his blood; the Holy Ghost
      is our Sanctifier, by his dwelling in our hearts. This doctrine of the Holy
      Trinity, hath always been defended and maintained by the true Church, since the
      time of the apostles, to this very day, against the Jews, Mohammedans, and some
      false Christians and heretics, as Marcion, Manes, Praxeas, Sabellius,
      Samosatenus, Arius, and such like, who have been justly condemned by the
      orthodox fathers. Therefore, in this point, we do willingly receive the three
      creeds, namely, that of the Apostles, of Nice, and of Athanasius: likewise
      that, which, conformable thereunto, is agreed upon by the ancient fathers.

  - name: That Jesus Christ is true and eternal God.
    number: 10
    text: >
      We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only
      begotten Son of God, begotten from eternity, not made nor created (for then he
      should be a creature), but co-essential and co-eternal with the Father, the
      express image of his person, and the brightness of his glory, equal unto him in
      all things. He is the Son of God, not only from the time that he assumed our
      nature, but from all eternity, as these testimonies, when compared together,
      teach us. Moses saith, that God created the world; and John saith, that all
      things were made by that Word, which he calleth God. And the apostle saith,
      that God make the worlds by his Son; likewise, that God created all things by
      Jesus Christ. Therefore it must needs follow, that he, who is called God, the
      Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ, did exist at that time, when all things were
      created by him. Therefore the prophet Micah saith, His goings forth have been
      from of old, from everlasting. And the apostle: He hath neither beginning of
      days, nor end of life. He therefore is that true, eternal, and almighty God,
      whom we invoke, worship and serve.

  - name: That the Holy Ghost is true and eternal God.
    number: 11
    text: >
      We believe and confess also, that the Holy Ghost, from eternity,
      proceeds from the Father and Son; and therefore neither is made,
      created, nor begotten, but only proceedeth from both; who in order is
      the third person of the Holy Trinity; of one and the same essence,
      majesty and glory with the Father, and the Son; and therefore, is the
      true and eternal God, as the Holy Scriptures teach us.

  - name: Of the Creation.
    number: 12
    text: >
      We believe that the Father, by the Word, that is, by his Son, hath
      created of nothing, the heaven, the earth, and all creatures, as it
      seemed good unto him, giving unto every creature its being, shape, form,
      and several offices to serve its Creator. That he doth also still uphold
      and govern them by his eternal providence, and infinite power, for the
      service of mankind, to the end that man may serve his God. He also
      created the angels good, to be his messengers and to serve his elect;
      some of which are fallen from that excellency, in which God created
      them, into everlasting perdition; and the others have, by the grace of
      God, remained steadfast and continued in their primitive state. The
      devils and evil spirits are so depraved, that they are enemies of God
      and every good thing, to the utmost of their power, as murderers,
      watching to ruin the Church and every member thereof, and by their
      wicked stratagems to destroy all; and are, therefore, by their own
      wickedness, adjudged to eternal damnation, daily expecting their
      horrible torments. Therefore we reject and abhor the error of the
      Sadducees, who deny the existence of spirits and angels: and also that
      of the Manichees, who assert that the devils have their origin of
      themselves, and that they are wicked of their own nature, without having
      been corrupted.

  - name: Of Divine Providence.
    number: 13
    text: >
      We believe that the same God, after he had created all things, did not
      forsake them, or give them up to fortune or chance, but that he rules
      and governs them according to his holy will, so that nothing happens in
      this world without his appointment: nevertheless, God neither is the
      author of, nor can be charged with, the sins which are committed. For
      his power and goodness are so great and incomprehensible, that he orders
      and executes his work in the most excellent and just manner, even then,
      when devils and wicked men act unjustly. And, as to what he doth
      surpassing human understanding, we will not curiously inquire into,
      farther than our capacity will admit of; but with the greatest humility
      and reverence adore the righteous judgments of God, which are hid from
      us, contenting ourselves that we are disciples of Christ, to learn only
      those things which he has revealed to us in his Word, without
      transgressing these limits. This doctrine affords us unspeakable
      consolation, since we are taught thereby that nothing can befall us by
      chance, but by the direction of our most gracious and heavenly Father;
      who watches over us with a paternal care, keeping all creatures so under
      his power, that not a hair of our head (for they are all numbered), nor
      a sparrow, can fall to the ground, without the will of our Father, in
      whom we do entirely trust; being persuaded, that he so restrains the
      devil and all our enemies, that without his will and permission, they
      cannot hurt us. And therefore we reject that damnable error of the
      Epicureans, who say that God regards nothing, but leaves all things to
      chance.

  - name: Of the Creation and Fall of man, and his Incapacity to perform what is truly good.
    number: 14
    text: >
      We believe that God created man out of the dust of the earth, and made
      and formed him after his own image and likeness, good, righteous, and
      holy, capable in all things to will, agreeably to the will of God. But
      being in honor, he understood it not, neither knew his excellency, but
      willfully subjected himself to sin, and consequently to death, and the
      curse, giving ear to the words of the devil. For the commandment of
      life, which he had received, he transgressed; and by sin separated
      himself from God, who was his true life, having corrupted his whole
      nature; whereby he made himself liable to corporal and spiritual death.
      And being thus become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways, he
      hath lost all his excellent gifts, which he had received from God, and
      only retained a few remains thereof, which, however, are sufficient to
      leave man without excuse; for all the light which is in us is changed
      into darkness, as the Scriptures teach us, saying: The light shineth in
      darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not: where St. John calleth
      men darkness. Therefore we reject all that is taught repugnant to this,
      concerning the free will of man, since man is but a slave to sin; and
      has nothing of himself, unless it is given from heaven. For who may
      presume to boast, that he of himself can do any good, since Christ
      saith, No man can come to me, except the Father, which hath sent me,
      draw him? Who will glory in his own will, who understands, that to be
      carnally minded is enmity against God? Who can speak of his knowledge,
      since the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God? In
      short, who dare suggest any thought, since he knows that we are not
      sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but that our
      sufficiency is of God? And therefore what the apostle saith ought justly
      to be held sure and firm, that God worketh in us both to will and to do
      of his good pleasure. For there is no will nor understanding,
      conformable to the divine will and understanding, but what Christ hath
      wrought in man; which he teaches us, when he saith, Without me ye can do
      nothing.

  - name: Of Original Sin.
    number: 15
    text: >
      We believe that, through the disobedience of Adam, original sin is
      extended to all mankind; which is a corruption of the whole nature, and
      an hereditary disease, wherewith infants themselves are infected even in
      their mother\'s womb, and which produceth in man all sorts of sin, being
      in him as a root thereof; and therefore is so vile and abominable in the
      sight of God, that it is sufficient to condemn all mankind. Nor is it by
      any means abolished or done away by baptism; since sin always issues
      forth from this woeful source, as water from a fountain; notwithstanding
      it is not imputed to the children of God unto condemnation, but by his
      grace and mercy is forgiven them. Not that they should rest securely in
      sin, but that a sense of this corruption should make believers often to
      sigh, desiring to be delivered from this body of death. Wherefore we
      reject the error of the Pelagians, who assert that sin proceeds only
      from imitation.

  - name: Of Eternal Election.
    number: 16
    text: >
      We believe that all the posterity of Adam being thus fallen into
      perdition and ruin, by the sin of our first parents, God then did
      manifest himself such as he is; that is to say, merciful and just:
      Merciful, since he delivers and preserves from this perdition all, whom
      he, in his eternal and unchangeable counsel of mere goodness, hath
      elected in Christ Jesus our Lord, without any respect to their works:
      Just, in leaving others in the fall and perdition wherein they have
      involved themselves.

  - name: Of the Recovery of Fallen Man.
    number: 17
    text: >
      We believe that our most gracious God, in his admirable wisdom and
      goodness, seeing that man had thus thrown himself into temporal and
      eternal death, and made himself wholly miserable, was pleased to seek
      and comfort him, when he trembling fled from his presence, promising him
      that he would give his Son, who should be made of a woman, to bruise the
      head of the serpent, and would make him happy.

  - name: Of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ.
    number: 18
    text: >
      We confess, therefore, that God did fulfill the promise, which he made
      to the fathers, by the mouth of his holy prophets, when he sent into the
      world, at the time appointed by him, his own, only-begotten and eternal
      Son, who took upon him the form of a servant, and became like unto man,
      really assuming the true human nature, with all its infirmities, sin
      excepted, being conceived in the womb of the blessed Virgin Mary, by the
      power of the Holy Ghost, without the means of man, and did not only
      assume human nature as to the body, but also a true human soul, that he
      might be a real man. For since the soul was lost as well as the body, it
      was necessary that he should take both upon him, to save both. Therefore
      we confess (in opposition to the heresy of the Anabaptists, who deny
      that Christ assumed human flesh of his mother) that Christ is become a
      partaker of the flesh and blood of the children; that he is a fruit of
      the loins of David after the flesh; made of the seed of David according
      to the flesh; a fruit of the womb of the Virgin Mary, made of a woman, a
      branch of David; a shoot of the root of Jesse; sprung from the tribe of
      Judah; descended from the Jews according to the flesh; of the seed of
      Abraham, since he took on him the seed of Abraham, and became like unto
      his brethren in all things, sin excepted, so that in truth he is our
      **Immanuel**, that is to say, God with us.

  - name: Of the union and distinction of the two Natures in the person of Christ.
    number: 19
    text: >
      We believe that by this conception, the person of the Son is inseparably
      united and connected with the human nature; so that there are not two
      Sons of God, nor two persons, but two natures united in one single
      person: yet, that each nature retains its own distinct properties. As
      then the divine nature hath always remained uncreated, without beginning
      of days or end of life, filling heaven and earth: so also hath the human
      nature not lost its properties, but remained a creature, having
      beginning of days, being a finite nature, and retaining all the
      properties of a real body. And though he hath by his resurrection given
      immortality to the same, nevertheless he hath not changed the reality of
      his human nature; forasmuch as our salvation and resurrection also
      depend on the reality of his body. But these two natures are so closely
      united in one person, that they were not separated even by his death.
      Therefore that which he, when dying, commended into the hands of his
      Father, was a real human spirit, departing from his body. But in the
      meantime the divine nature always remained united with the human, even
      when he lay in the grave. And the Godhead did not cease to be in him,
      any more than it did when he was an infant, though it did not so clearly
      manifest itself for a while. Wherefore we confess, that he is **very
      God, and very Man**: very God by his power to conquer death; and very
      man that he might die for us according to the infirmity of his flesh.

  - name: That God hath manifested his justice and mercy in Christ Jesus.
    number: 20
    text: >
      We believe that God, who is perfectly merciful and just, sent his Son to
      assume that nature, in which the disobedience was committed, to make
      satisfaction in the same, and to bear the punishment of sin by his most
      bitter passion and death. God therefore manifested his justice against
      his Son, when he laid our iniquities upon him; and poured forth his
      mercy and goodness on us, who were guilty and worthy of damnation, out
      of mere and perfect love, giving his Son unto death for us, and raising
      him for our justification, that through him we might obtain immortality
      and life eternal.

  - name: Of the satisfaction of Christ, our only High Priest, for us.
    number: 21
    text: >
      We believe that Jesus Christ is ordained with an oath to be an
      everlasting High Priest, after the order of Melchisedec; and that he
      hath presented himself in our behalf before the Father, to appease his
      wrath by his full satisfaction, by offering himself on the tree of the
      cross, and pouring out his precious blood to purge away our sins; as the
      prophets had foretold. For it is written: He was wounded for our
      transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
      our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. He was
      brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and numbered with the transgressors,
      and condemned by Pontius Pilate as a malefactor, though he had first
      declared him innocent. Therefore: he restored that which he took not
      away, and suffered, the just for the unjust, as well in his body as in
      his soul, feeling the terrible punishment which our sins had merited;
      insomuch that his sweat became like unto drops of blood falling on the
      ground. He called out, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? and
      hath suffered all this for the remission of our sins. Wherefore we
      justly say with the apostle Paul: that we know nothing, but Jesus
      Christ, and him crucified; we count all things but loss and dung for the
      excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, in whose wounds we
      find all manner of consolation. Neither is it necessary to seek or
      invent any other means of being reconciled to God, than this only
      sacrifice, once offered, by which believers are made perfect forever.
      This is also the reason why he was called by the angel of God,
      **Jesus**, that is to say, **Savior**, because he should save his people
      from their sins.

  - name: Of Faith in Jesus Christ.
    number: 22
    text: >
      We believe that, to attain the true knowledge of this great mystery, the
      Holy Ghost kindleth in our hearts an upright faith, which embraces Jesus
      Christ, with all his merits, appropriates him, and seeks nothing more
      besides him. For it must needs follow, either that all things, which are
      requisite to our salvation, are not in Jesus Christ, or if all things
      are in him, that then those who possess Jesus Christ through faith, have
      complete salvation in him. Therefore, for any to assert, that Christ is
      not sufficient, but that something more is required besides him, would
      be too gross a blasphemy: for hence it would follow, that Christ was but
      half a Savior. Therefore we justly say with Paul, that we are justified
      by faith alone, or by faith without works. However, to speak more
      clearly, we do not mean, that faith itself justifies us, for it is only
      an instrument with which we embrace Christ our Righteousness. But Jesus
      Christ, imputing to us all his merits and so many holy works which he
      has done for us, and in our stead, is our Righteousness. And faith is an
      instrument that keeps us in communion with him in all his benefits,
      which, when become ours, are more than sufficient to acquit us of our
      sins.

  - name: Of Justification.

      We believe that our salvation consists in the remission of our sins for
      Jesus Christ's sake, and that therein our righteousness before God is
      implied: as David and Paul teach us, declaring this to be the happiness
      of man, that God imputes righteousness to him without works. And the
      same apostle saith, that we are justified freely by his grace, through
      the redemption which is in Jesus Christ. And therefore we always hold
      fast this foundation, ascribing all the glory to God, humbling ourselves
      before him, and acknowledging ourselves to be such as we really are,
      without presuming to trust in any thing in ourselves, or in any merit of
      ours, relying and resting upon the obedience of Christ crucified alone,
      which becomes ours, when we believe in him. This is sufficient to cover
      our iniquities, and to give us confidence in approaching to God; freeing
      the conscience of fear, terror and dread, without following the example
      of our first father, Adam, who, trembling, attempted to cover himself
      with fig-leaves. And verily if we should appear before God, relying on
      ourselves, or on any other creature, though ever so little, we should,
      alas! be consumed. And therefore every one must pray with David: O Lord,
      enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man
      living be justified.

  - name: Of man's Sanctification and Good Works.
    number: 24

      We believe that this true faith being wrought in man by the hearing of
      the Word of God, and the operation of the Holy Ghost, doth regenerate
      and make him a new man, causing him to live a new life, and freeing him
      from the bondage of sin. Therefore it is so far from being true, that
      this justifying faith makes men remiss in a pious and holy life, that on
      the contrary without it they would never do anything out of love to God,
      but only out of self-love or fear of damnation. Therefore it is
      impossible that this holy faith can be unfruitful in man: for we do not
      speak of a vain faith, but of such a faith, which is called in
      Scripture, a faith that worketh by love, which excites man to the
      practice of those works, which God has commanded in his Word. Which
      works, as they proceed from the good root of faith, are good and
      acceptable in the sight of God, forasmuch as they are all sanctified by
      his grace: howbeit they are of no account towards our justification. For
      it is by faith in Christ that we are justified, even before we do good
      works; otherwise they could not be good works, any more than the fruit
      of a tree can be good, before the tree itself is good. Therefore we do
      good works, but not to merit by them, (for what can they merit?) nay, we
      are beholden to God for the good works we do, and not he to us, since it
      is he that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
      Let us therefore attend to what is written: when ye shall have done all
      those things which are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants;
      we have done that which was our duty to do. In the meantime, we do not
      deny that God rewards our good works, but it is through his grace that
      he crowns his gifts. Moreover, though we do good works, we do not found
      our salvation upon them; for we do no work but what is polluted by our
      flesh, and also punishable; and although we could perform such works,
      still the remembrance of one sin is sufficient to make God reject them.
      Thus then we would always be in doubt, tossed to and fro without any
      certainty, and our poor consciences continually vexed, if they relied
      not on the merits of the suffering and death of our Savior.

      substance of them remain with us in Jesus Christ, in whom they have
      their completion. In the meantime, we still use the testimonies taken
      out of the law and the prophets, to confirm us in the doctrine of the
      gospel, and to regulate our life in all honesty, to the glory of God,
      according to his will.

  - name: Of Christ's Intercession.
    number: 26
    text: >
      We believe that we have no access unto God, but alone through the only
      Mediator and Advocate, Jesus Christ the righteous, who therefore became
      man, having united in one person the divine and human natures, that we
      men might have access to the divine Majesty, which access would
      otherwise be barred against us. But this Mediator, whom the Father has
      appointed between him and us, ought in no wise to affright us by his
      majesty, or cause us to seek another according to our fancy. For there
      is no creature either in heaven or on earth who loveth us more than
      Jesus Christ; who, though he was in the form of God, yet made himself of
      no reputation, and took upon him the form of a man, and of a servant for
      us, and was made like unto his brethren in all things. If then we should
      seek for another Mediator, who would be well affected towards us, whom
      could we find, who loved us more than he, who laid down his life for us,
      even when we were his enemies? And if we seek for one who hath power and
      majesty, who is there that has so much of both as he who sits at the
      right hand of his Father, and who hath all power in heaven and on earth?
      And who will sooner be heard than the own well beloved Son of God?
      Therefore it was only through distrust that this practice of
      dishonoring, instead of honoring the saints, was introduced, doing that,
      which they never have done, nor required, but have on the contrary
      steadfastly rejected according to their bounden duty, as appears by
      their writings. Neither must we plead here our unworthiness; for the
      meaning is not that we should offer our prayers to God on the ground of
      our own worthiness but only on the ground of the excellency and
      worthiness of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose righteousness is become ours
      by faith. Therefore the apostle, to remove this foolish fear, or rather
      mistrust from us, justly saith, that Jesus Christ was made like unto his
      brethren in all things, that he might be a merciful and faithful High
      Priest, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that
      he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succor them that
      are tempted; and further to encourage us, he adds, seeing then that we
      have a great High Priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son
      of God, let us hold fast the profession. For we have not an high priest
      which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in
      all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore
      come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
      grace to help in time of need. The same apostle saith, having boldness
      to enter into the holiest, by the blood of Jesus; let us draw near with
      a true heart in full assurance of faith, etc. Likewise, Christ hath an
      unchangeable priesthood, wherefore he is able also to save them to the
      uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
      intercession for them. What more can be required? since Christ himself
      saith, I am the way and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
      Father but by me. To what purpose would we then seek another advocate,
      since it has pleased God, to give us his own Son as an advocate? Let us
      not forsake him to take another, or rather to seek after another,
      without ever being able to find him; for God well knew, when he gave him
      to us, that we were sinners. Therefore according to the command of
      Christ, we call upon the heavenly Father through Jesus Christ our own
      Mediator, as we are taught in the Lord\'s prayer; being assured that
      whatever we ask of the Father in his name, will be granted us.

      holy congregation, of true Christian believers, all expecting their
      salvation in Jesus Christ, being washed by his blood, sanctified and

      the world, and will be to the end thereof; which is evident from this,
      that Christ is an eternal King, which, without subjects, cannot be. And
      this holy Church is preserved or supported by God, against the rage of
      the whole world; though she sometimes (for a while) appears very small,
      and in the eyes of men, to be reduced to nothing: as during the perilous
      reign of Ahab, the Lord reserved unto him seven thousand men, who had
      not bowed their knees to Baal. Furthermore, this holy Church is not
      confined, bound, or limited to a certain place or to certain persons,
      but is spread and dispersed over the whole world; and yet is joined and
      united with heart and will, by the power of faith, in one and the same
      spirit.

      We believe, since this holy congregation is an assembly of those who are
      saved, and that out of it there is no salvation, that no person of
      whatsoever state or condition he may be, ought to withdraw himself, to
      live in a separate state from it; but that all men are in duty bound to
      join and unite themselves with it; maintaining the unity of the Church;
      submitting themselves to the doctrine and discipline thereof; bowing
      their necks under the yoke of Jesus Christ; and as mutual members of the
      same body, serving to the edification of the brethren, according to the
      talents God has given them. And that this may be the more effectually
      observed, it is the duty of all believers, according to the word of God,
      to separate themselves from all those who do not belong to the Church,
      and to join themselves to this congregation, wheresoever God hath
      established it, even though the magistrates and edicts of princes were
      against it, yea, though they should suffer death or any other corporal
      punishment. Therefore all those, who separate themselves from the same,
      or do not join themselves to it, act contrary to the ordinance of God.

  - name: Of the marks of the true Church, and wherein she differs from the false Church.
    number: 29

      We believe, that we ought diligently and circumspectly to discern from
      the Word of God which is the true Church, since all sects which are in
      the world assume to themselves the name of the Church. But we speak not
      here of hypocrites, who are mixed in the Church with the good, yet are
      not of the Church, though externally in it; but we say that the body and
      communion of the true Church must be distinguished from all sects, who
      call themselves the Church. The marks, by which the true Church is
      known, are these: if the pure doctrine of the gospel is preached
      therein; if she maintains the pure administration of the sacraments as
      instituted by Christ; if church discipline is exercised in punishing of
      sin: in short, if all things are managed according to the pure Word of
      God, all things contrary thereto rejected, and Jesus Christ acknowledged
      as the only Head of the Church. Hereby the true Church may certainly be
      known, from which no man has a right to separate himself. With respect
      to those, who are members of the Church, they may be known by the marks
      of Christians: namely, by faith; and when they have received Jesus
      Christ the only Savior, they avoid sin, follow after righteousness, love
      the true God and their neighbor, neither turn aside to the right or
      left, and crucify the flesh with the works thereof. But this is not to
      be understood, as if there did not remain in them great infirmities; but
      they fight against them through the Spirit, all the days of their life,
      continually taking their refuge in the blood, death, passion and
      obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, "in whom they have remission of
      sins, through faith in him." As for the false Church, she ascribes more
      power and authority to herself and her ordinances than to the Word of
      God, and will not submit herself to the yoke of Christ. Neither does she
      administer the sacraments as appointed by Christ in his Word, but adds
      to and takes from them, as she thinks proper; she relieth more upon men
      than upon Christ; and persecutes those, who live holily according to the
      Word of God, and rebuke her for her errors, covetousness, and idolatry.
      These two Churches are easily known and distinguished from each other.

      We believe, that this true Church must be governed by that spiritual
      policy which our Lord hath taught us in his Word; namely, that there
      must be ministers or pastors to preach the Word of God, and to
      administer the sacraments; also elders and deacons, who, together with
      the pastors, form the council of the Church: that by these means true
      religion may be preserved, and the true doctrine everywhere propagated,
      likewise transgressors punished and restrained by spiritual means: also
      that the poor and distressed may be relieved and comforted, according to
      their necessities. By these means everything will be carried on in the
      Church with good order and decency, when faithful men are chosen,
      according to the rule prescribed by St. Paul in his Epistle to Timothy.

      election by the Church, with calling upon the name of the Lord, and in
      that order which the Word of God teacheth. Therefore every one must take
      heed, not to intrude himself by indecent means, but is bound to wait
      till it shall please God to call him; that he may have testimony of his
      calling, and be certain and assured that it is of the Lord. As for the
      ministers of God\'s Word, they have equally the same power and authority
      wheresoever they are, as they are all ministers of Christ, the only
      universal Bishop, and the only Head of the Church. Moreover, that this
      holy ordinance of God may not be violated or slighted, we say that every
      one ought to esteem the ministers of God\'s Word, and the elders of the
      Church, very highly for their work\'s sake, and be at peace with them
      without murmuring, strife or contention, as much as possible.

      In the meantime we believe, though it is useful and beneficial, that
      those, who are rulers of the Church, institute and establish certain
      ordinances among themselves for maintaining the body of the Church; yet
      they ought studiously to take care, that they do not depart from those
      things which Christ, our only Master, hath instituted. And therefore, we
      reject all human inventions, and all laws, which man would introduce
      into the worship of God, thereby to bind and compel the conscience in
      any manner whatever. Therefore we admit only of that which tends to
      nourish and preserve concord, and unity, and to keep all men in
      obedience to God. For this purpose, ex-communication or church
      discipline is requisite, with the several circumstances belonging to it,
      according to the Word of God.

      his promises, and to be pledges of the good will and grace of God toward
      us, and also to nourish and strengthen our faith; which he hath joined
      to the Word of the gospel, the better to present to our senses, both
      that which he signifies to us by his Word, and that which he works
      inwardly in our hearts, thereby assuring and confirming in us the
      salvation which he imparts to us. For they are visible signs and seals
      of an inward and invisible thing, by means whereof God worketh in us by
      the power of the Holy Ghost. Therefore the signs are not in vain or
      insignificant, so as to deceive us. For Jesus Christ is the true object
      presented by them, without whom they would be of no moment. Moreover, we
      are satisfied with the number of sacraments which Christ our Lord hath
      instituted, which are two only, namely, the sacrament of baptism, and
      the holy supper of our Lord Jesus Christ.

  - name: Of Holy Baptism.
    number: 34
    text: >
      We believe and confess that Jesus Christ, who is the end of the law,
      hath made an end, by the shedding of his blood, of all other sheddings
      of blood which men could or would make as a propitiation or satisfaction
      for sin: and that he, having abolished circumcision, which was done with
      blood, hath instituted the sacrament of baptism, instead thereof; by
      which we are received into the Church of God, and separated from all
      other people and strange religions, that we may wholly belong to him,
      whose ensign and banner we bear: and which serves as a testimony to us,
      that he will forever be our gracious God and Father. Therefore he has
      commanded all those, who are his, to be baptized with pure water, "in
      the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost": thereby
      signifying to us, that as water washeth away the filth of the body, when
      poured upon it, and is seen on the body of the baptized, when sprinkled
      upon him; so doth the blood of Christ, by the power of the Holy Ghost,
      internally sprinkle the soul, cleanse it from its sins, and regenerate
      us from children of wrath, unto children of God. Not that this is
      effected by the external water, but by the sprinkling of the precious
      blood of the Son of God; who is our Red Sea, through which we must pass,
      to escape the tyranny of Pharaoh, that is, the devil, and to enter into
      the spiritual land of Canaan. Therefore the ministers, on their part,
      administer the sacrament, and that which is visible, but our Lord giveth
      that which is signified by the sacrament, namely, the gifts and
      invisible grace; washing, cleansing and purging our souls of all filth
      and unrighteousness; renewing our hearts, and filling them with all
      comfort; giving unto us a true assurance of his fatherly goodness;
      putting on us the new man, and putting off the old man with all his
      deeds. Therefore we believe, that every man, who is earnestly studious
      of obtaining life eternal, ought to be but once baptized with this only
      baptism, without ever repeating the same: since we cannot be born twice.
      Neither doth this baptism only avail us, at the time when the water is
      poured upon us, and received by us, but also through the whole course of
      our life; therefore we detest the error of the Anabaptists, who are not
      content with the one only baptism they have once received, and moreover
      condemn the baptism of the infants of believers, whom we believe ought
      to be baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant, as the children
      in Israel formerly were circumcised, upon the same promises which are
      made unto our children. And indeed Christ shed his blood no less for the
      washing of the children of the faithful, than for adult persons; and
      therefore they ought to receive the sign and sacrament of that, which
      Christ hath done for them; as the Lord commanded in the law, that they
      should be made partakers of the sacrament of Christ\'s suffering and
      death, shortly after they were born, by offering for them a lamb, which
      was a sacrament of Jesus Christ. Moreover, what circumcision was to the
      Jews, that baptism is for our children. And for this reason Paul calls
      baptism the circumcision of Christ.

  - name: Of the Holy Supper of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    number: 35
    text: >
      We believe and confess, that our Savior Jesus Christ did ordain and
      institute the sacrament of the holy supper, to nourish and support those
      whom he hath already regenerated, and incorporated into his family,
      which is his Church. Now those, who are regenerated, have in them a
      two-fold life, the one corporal and temporal, which they have from the
      first birth, and is common to all men: the other spiritual and heavenly,
      which is given them in their second birth, which is effected by the word
      of the gospel, in the communion of the body of Christ; and this life is
      not common, but is peculiar to God\'s elect. In like manner God hath
      given us, for the support of the bodily and earthly life, earthly and
      common bread, which is subservient thereto, and is common to all men,
      even as life itself. But for the support of the spiritual and heavenly
      life, which believers have, he hath sent a living bread, which descended
      from heaven, namely, Jesus Christ, who nourishes and strengthens the
      spiritual life of believers, when they eat him, that is to say, when
      they apply and receive him by faith in the spirit. Christ, that he might
      represent unto us this spiritual and heavenly bread, hath instituted an
      earthly and visible bread, as a sacrament of his body, and wine as a
      sacrament of his blood, to testify by them unto us, that, as certainly
      as we receive and hold this sacrament in our hands, and eat and drink
      the same with our mouths, by which our life is afterwards nourished, we
      also do as certainly receive by faith (which is the hand and mouth of
      our soul) the true body and blood of Christ our only Savior in our
      souls, for the support of our spiritual life. Now, as it is certain and
      beyond all doubt, that Jesus Christ hath not enjoined to us the use of
      his sacraments in vain, so he works in us all that he represents to us
      by these holy signs, though the manner surpasses our understanding, and
      cannot be comprehended by us, as the operations of the Holy Ghost are
      hidden and incomprehensible. In the meantime we err not, when we say,
      that what is eaten and drunk by us is the proper and natural body, and
      the proper blood of Christ. But the manner of our partaking of the same,
      is not by the mouth, but by the spirit through faith. Thus then, though
      Christ always sits at the right hand of his Father in the heavens, yet
      doth he not therefore cease to make us partakers of himself by faith.
      This feast is a spiritual table, at which Christ communicates himself
      with all his benefits to us, and gives us there to enjoy both himself,
      and the merits of his suffering and death, nourishing, strengthening and
      comforting our poor comfortless souls by the eating of his flesh,
      quickening and refreshing them by the drinking of his blood. Further,
      though the sacraments are connected with the thing signified,
      nevertheless both are not received by all men: the ungodly indeed
      receives the sacrament to his condemnation, but he doth not receive the
      truth of the sacrament. As Judas, and Simon the sorcerer, both indeed
      received the sacrament, but not Christ, who was signified by it, of whom
      believers only are made partakers. Lastly, we receive this holy
      sacrament in the assembly of the people of God, with humility and
      reverence, keeping up amongst us a holy remembrance of the death of
      Christ our Savior, with thanksgiving: making there confession of our
      faith, and of the Christian religion. Therefore no one ought to come to
      this table without having previously rightly examined himself; lest by
      eating of this bread and drinking of this cup, he eat and drink judgment
      to himself. In a word, we are excited by the use of this holy sacrament,
      to a fervent love towards God and our neighbor. Therefore we reject all
      mixtures and damnable inventions, which men have added unto, and blended
      with the sacraments, as profanations of them: and affirm that we ought
      to rest satisfied with the ordinance which Christ and his apostles have
      taught us, and that we must speak of them in the same manner as they
      have spoken.

      We believe that our gracious God, because of the depravity of mankind, hath
      appointed kings, princes and magistrates, willing that the world should be
      governed by certain laws and policies; to the end that the dissoluteness of men
      might be restrained, and all things carried on among them with good order and
      decency. For this purpose he hath invested the magistracy with the sword, for
      the punishment of evil-doers, and for the protection of them that do well. And
      their office is, not only to have regard unto, and watch for the welfare of the
      civil state; but also that they protect the sacred ministry; and thus may
      remove and prevent all idolatry and false worship; that the kingdom of
      anti-Christ may be thus destroyed and the kingdom of Christ promoted. They must
      therefore countenance the preaching of the Word of the gospel everywhere, that
      God may be honored and worshipped by every one, of what state, quality, or
      condition so ever he may be, to subject himself to the magistrates; to pay
      tribute, to show due honor and respect to them, and to obey them in all things
      which are not repugnant to the Word of God; to supplicate for them in their
      prayers, that God may rule and guide them in all their ways, and that we may
      lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. Wherefore we
      detest the Anabaptists and other seditious people, and in general all those who
      reject the higher powers and magistrates, and would subvert justice, introduce
      community of goods, and confound that decency and good order, which God hath
      established among men.

  - name: Of the Last Judgment.

      Finally we believe, according to the Word of God, when the time appointed by
      the Lord (which is unknown to all creatures) is come, and the number of the
      elect complete, that our Lord Jesus Christ will come from heaven, corporally
      and visibly, as he ascended, with great glory and majesty to declare himself
      judge of the quick and the dead; burning this old world with fire and flame, to
      cleanse it. And then all men will personally appear before this great judge,
      both men and women and children, that have been from the beginning of the world
      to the end thereof, being summoned by the voice of the archangel, and by the
      sound of the trumpet of God. For all the dead shall be raised out of the earth,
      and their souls joined and united with their proper bodies, in which they
      formerly lived. As for those who shall then be living, they shall not die as
      the others, but be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and from corruptible,
      become incorruptible. Then the books (that is to say the consciences) shall be
      opened, and the dead judged according to what they shall have done in this
      world, whether it be good or evil. Nay, all men shall give an account of every
      idle word they have spoken, which the world only counts amusement and jest: and
      then the secrets and hypocrisy of men shall be disclosed and laid open before
      all. And therefore the consideration of this judgment, is justly terrible and
      dreadful to the wicked and ungodly, but most desirable and comfortable to the
      righteous and elect: because then their full deliverance shall be perfected,
      and there they shall receive the fruits of their labor and trouble which they
      have borne. Their innocence shall be known to all, and they shall see the
      terrible vengeance which God shall execute on the wicked, who most cruelly
      persecuted, oppressed and tormented them in this world; and who shall be
      convicted by the testimony of their own consciences, and being immortal, shall
      be tormented in that everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his
      angels. But on the contrary, the faithful and elect shall be crowned with glory
      and honor; and the Son of God will confess their names before God his Father,
      and his elect angels; all tears shall be wiped from their eyes; and their cause
      which is now condemned by many judges and magistrates, as heretical and
      impious, will then be known to be the cause of the Son of God. And for a
      gracious reward, the Lord will cause them to possess such a glory, as never
      entered into the heart of man to conceive. Therefore we expect that great day
      with a most ardent desire to the end that we may fully enjoy the promises of
      God in Christ Jesus our Lord. AMEN.
