      For the maintenance of good order in the Church of Christ it is
      necessary that there should be: offices; assemblies; supervision of
      doctrine, sacraments, and ceremonies; and Christian discipline; of
      which matters the following articles treat in due order.

      ## First Head - Of the Offices

  - name: Article 2
    text: |

      The offices are of four kinds: of the Ministers of the Word, of the
      Professors of Theology, of the Elders, and of the Deacons.

  - name: Article 3
    text: |

      No one, though he be a Professor of Theology. Elder, or Deacon, shall
      be permitted to enter upon the ministry of the Word and the Sacraments
      without having been lawfully called thereunto. And when any one acts
      contrary thereto, and after being frequently admonished does not
      desist, the Classis shall judge whether he is to be declared a
      schismatic or is to be punished in some other way.

  - name: Article 4
    text: |

      The lawful calling of those who have not previously been in office, in
      cities as well as rural districts, consists:
      First, in the Election, after previous fasting and prayer, by the
      Consistory and Deacons, not without (proper correspondence with the
      Christian magistrates of the respective districts, and) the knowledge
      or advice of the Classis, where this had been customary up to now.
      Secondly, in the Examination, both of doctrine and life, by the
      Classis, in the presence of all, or some of the delegates of Synod.
      Thirdly, in the Approbation and endorsement (by the magistrates and
      then also) by the members of the Reformed Congregation of that city,
      if, the name of the Minister having been announced in the churches
      over a period of fourteen days, no objection arises.
      Finally, in the public Ordination before the congregation, which
      shall take place with appropriate stipulations and interrogations,
      prayer and the laying on of the hands by the ordaining Minister and by
      other Ministers, if more are present, in accordance with the Form for
      this purpose. It is understood that the imposition of hands may take
      place in the Classical assembly to the newly graduated Ministers,
      being sent to the Churches under the Cross.

  - name: Article 5
    text: |

      Ministers already in the ministry of the Word who are called to
      another congregation, shall likewise be called in this manner,
      (including aforesaid correspondence) in cities as well as rural
      districts, by the Consistory and the Deacons, with the advice or
      approval of the Classis, to whom the aforesaid Ministers called, shall
      show good ecclesiastical testimonials of doctrine and life; (after
      approval by the magistrate of the respective district and) after being
      presented to the congregation over a period of fourteen days, as
      before stated, they shall be installed after previous stipulations and
      prayers. All due regard must also be given here to the things
      previously mentioned with respect to proper right of presentation, or
      any other right, in so far as it can be employed to edification,
      without detriment to the Church of God and good Church Order; to which
      (the Civil Authorities and) the Synods of the respective districts are
      to give their careful attention, and make proper regulations, to the
      welfare of the Churches.

  - name: Article 6
    text: |

      No minister shall be at liberty to serve in any private manors,
      institutions of mercy, or otherwise, unless he previously be admitted
      in accordance with the preceding Articles; and he shall, no less than
      others, be subject to the Church Order.

  - name: Article 7
    text: |

      No one shall be called to the ministry of the Word without stationing

      extension work.

  - name: Article 8
    text: |

      No school teachers, artisans, or others who have not studied, shall be
      admitted to the ministry, unless there is definite assurance of their
      beings exceptionally gifted, godly, humble, modest, and possessed of
      good sense and discretion, as well as gifts of public address. When
      such persons present themselves for the ministry, the Classis shall
      (if the Synod approve) first examine them, and, the examination being
      satisfactory, permit them to preach in private for a certain length of
      time, and then further deal with them as it shall deem edifying

      held the office of elder and deacon, together with the magistrate),
      nor without the knowledge of the Classis; likewise no other church

      served.

  - name: Article 11
    text: |

      On the other hand, the Consistory, as representing the congregation,
      shall also be bound to provide for the proper support of its
      Ministers, and shall not dismiss them without the knowledge and
      judgment of the Classis who, in the event of lack of support, shall
      judge whether or not to remove aforesaid Ministers.

      weighty reasons, which shall be subject to the cognizance and judgment
      of the Classis.

  - name: Article 13
    text: |

      In the event that Ministers are rendered incapable of performing the

      permitted to preach or administer the Sacraments in another Church
      without the consent of the Consistory.

      take heed whether the Ministers, Consistories, and School-teachers
      faithfully perform the duties of their offices, adhere to sound
      doctrine, observe in all things the adopted order, and properly
      promote as much as lies in them, by word and deed, the edification of
      the Congregation including the youth, to the end that they may in time
      fraternally admonish those who have in anything been negligent, and
      may by their advice and assistance help direct all things unto peace,
      upbuilding, and neatest profit of the Churches and Schools. And each

    text: |
      Each Synod shall delegate some to execute everything ordained by Synod
      both as to what pertains to the High Authorities and to the respective

      in all other eventual difficulties they shall extend help to the
      Classes in order that proper unity, order, and soundness of doctrine
      may be maintained and established. They shall also keep proper record

      with appointing the time and place of the General Synod shall convene
      its Particular Synod if the General Synod is to be called within the
      three years (and inform the nearest church speaking the other
      language, which is to send four persons there) to determine jointly
      the time and place. (When the church which has been appointed to
      convene the General Synod is consulting with the Classis regarding the
      time and place, it is to inform the High Authorities in due time, that
      with their knowledge, if it be their pleasure also to send some to the
      Classis, the matter be decided in the presence and with the advice of
      their Deputies.)

  - name: Article 51
    text: |

      (Whereas two languages are spoken in the Netherlands, it is deemed

      it is proper that such be taken who agree with the pure doctrine and
      are pious in their conversation.

      the Classis (and of the Authorities who favour the Reformed Religion).

      If funeral sermons are not in use, they are not to be introduced, and
      if they already have come to be accepted, diligence shall be exercised
      to dispose of them by the most suitable means.

  - name: Article 66
    text: |

      In times of war, pestilence, calamities, heavy persecution of the
      Churches, and other general distresses, the Ministers of the Churches
      shall request the Government to employ their authority and command
      that public days of Fasting and Prayer be appointed and set aside.

  - name: Article 67
    text: |

      The Churches shall observe, in addition to Sunday, also Christmas,
      Easter, and Pentecost, with the following day, and whereas in most of
      the cities and provinces of the Netherlands the day of Circumcision
      and of Ascension of Christ are also observed, Ministers in every place
      where this is not yet done shall take steps with the Government to
      have them conform with the others.

  - name: Article 68
    text: |

      The Ministers everywhere shall briefly explain on Sunday, ordinarily
      in the afternoon sermon, the sum of Christian doctrine comprehended in
      the Catechism which at present is accepted in the Netherland Churches,
      so that it may be completed every year in accordance with the devision

      Whereas up to now various usages in regard to marriages are maintained
      everywhere, and it nevertheless is proper that uniformity be exercised
      in this matter, therefore the Churches shall adhere to the method
      which they, in conformity to the Word of God and previous
      ecclesiastical regulations have maintained up to now, until the High
      Authorities (which are to be asked to do so at the earliest
      opportunity) shall prepare a general Regulation with the advice of the
      Ministers of the Churches, to which this Church Order refers itself in
      this matter.


      ## Fourth Head - Of Censure and Ecclesiastical Admonition


  - name: Article 71
    text: |

      As Christian discipline is of a spiritual nature, and exempts no one
      from civil trial or punishment by the authorities, so also besides
      civil punishment there is need of ecclesiastical censure, to reconcile
      the sinner with the Church and with his neighbour, and to remove the
      offense out of the Church of Christ.

  - name: Article 72
    text: |

      In case anyone transgresses against the purity of doctrine or
      godliness of conversation, as long as it is of a private character and
      has not given public offense, the rule clearly prescribed by Christ in
      Matthew 18 shall be followed.

  - name: Article 73
    text: |

      Secret sins of which the sinner repent after being admonished by one
      person in private or in the presence of two or three witnesses, shall
      not be laid before the Consistory.

  - name: Article 74
    text: |

      If anyone, having been admonished in love concerning a secret sin by
      two or three persons, does not give heed, or otherwise has committed a
      public sin, the matter shall be reported to the Consistory.

  - name: Article 75
    text: |

      The reconciliation of all such sins as are of their nature of a public
      character, or have become public because the admonition of the Church
      was despised, shall take place, when definite signs of repentance are
      evident, publicly, by the judgment of the Consistory; and in rural
      districts or smaller towns having only one Minister, with the advice
      of two neighbouring Churches, in such a form and manner as shall be
      judged to be conducive to the edification of each Church.

  - name: Article 76
    text: |

      Such as obstinately reject the admonition of the Consistory, and
      likewise those who have committed a public or otherwise gross sin,
      shall be suspended from the Lord's Supper. And if he, having been
      suspended after repeated admonitions, shows no signs of repentance,
      the Consistory shall at last proceed to the extreme remedy, namely,
      excommunication, agreeably to the Form adopted for that purpose
      according to the Word of God. But no one shall be excommunicated
      except with previous advice of Classis.

  - name: Article 77
    text: |

      Before proceeding to excommunication, the obstinacy of the sinner
      shall be publicly made known to the Congregation, explaining the
      offense, together with the diligence bestowed upon him in reproof,
      suspension from the Lord's Supper, and manifold admonitions; and the
      Congregation shall be exhorted to speak to him and to pray for him.
      There shall be three such admonitions. In the first the name of the
      sinner shall not be mentioned, that he be somewhat spared. In the
      second, with the advice of the Classis, his name shall be mentioned.
      In the third the Congregation shall be informed that, unless he
      repent, he will be excluded from the fellowship of the Church, so that
      his excommunication, in case he remains obstinate, may take place with
      the tacit approbation of the Church. The interval between the
      admonition shall be left to the discretion of the Consistory.

  - name: Article 78
    text: |

      Whenever anyone who has been excommunicated desire to become
      reconciled to the Church in the way of penitence, it shall be
      announced to the Congregation, either before the administration of the
      Lord's Supper or at some opportune time, in order that, in so far as
      no one can mention anything against him to the contrary, at the next
      Lord's Supper he may, with profession of his repentance be publicly
      reinstated according to the Form for that purpose.

  - name: Article 79
    text: |

      When Ministers of the Divine Word, Elders, or Deacons have committed
      any public, gross sin, which is a disgrace to the Church, or worthy of
      punishment by the Authorities, the Elders and Deacons shall
      immediately, by preceding sentence of the Consistory of that Church
      and the nearest adjoining Church, be deposed from their office, but
      the Ministers shall be suspended. But whether or not they are to be
      entirely deposed from their office shall be subject to the judgment of
      the Classis.

  - name: Article 80
    text: |

      Furthermore, among the gross sins which are worthy of being punished
      with suspension or deposition from office, these are the principal
      ones: false doctrine or heresy, public schism, public blasphemy,
      simony, faithless desertion of office or intrusion upon that of
      another, perjury, adultery, fornication, theft, acts of violence,
      habitual drunkenness, brawling, filthy lucre; in short, all sins and
      gross offenses as render the perpetrators infamous before the world,
      and which in any private member of the Church would cause him to be
      considered worthy of excommunication.

  - name: Article 81
    text: |

      The Ministers of the Word, Elders, and Deacons shall exercise
      Christian censure among themselves, and in a friendly spirit admonish
      one another with regard to the discharge of their office.

  - name: Article 82
    text: |

      To those who remove from the Congregation, a Certificate of Dismission
      or testimony regarding their conversation shall be given them at the
      discretion of the Consistory, under the seal of the Church, or where
      there is no seal, signed by two.

  - name: Article 83
    text: |

      Furthermore, the poor shall, when removing for sufficient reasons,
      receive assistance from the Deacons at their discretion provided it be
      noted on the reverse side of their Certificate of Dismission to places
      to which they wish to go, and the assistance they have received.

  - name: Article 84
    text: |

      No church shall in any way lord it over other Churches, no Minister
      over other Ministers, no Elder or Deacon over other Elders or Deacons.

  - name: Article 85
    text: |

      Foreign Churches whose usages regarding nonessentials differ from ours
      shall not be rejected.

  - name: Article 86
    text: |

      These Articles, relating to the lawful Order of the Churches, have
      been so drafted and adopted by common convent, that they, if the
      profit of the Churches demand otherwise, may and ought to be altered,
      augmented, or diminished. However, no particular Congregation,
      Classis, or Synod shall be at liberty to do so, but they shall show
      all diligence in observing them, until it be otherwise ordained by the
      General, or National Synod.

      WE, the undersigned, Professors of The . . . Reformed Church,
      Ministers of the Gospel, Elders and Deacons of The . . . Reformed
      congregation of . . . of the Classis of . . . do hereby sincerely and
      in good conscience before the Lord, declare by this, our subscription,
      that we heartily believe and are persuaded that all the articles and
      points of doctrine, contained in the Confession and Catechism of the
      Reformed Churches, together with the explanation of some points of the
      aforesaid doctrine, made by the National Synod of Dordrecht, 1618-'19,
      do fully agree with the Word of God.
      We promise therefore diligently to teach and faithfully to defend the
      aforesaid doctrine, without either directly or indirectly
      contradicting the same, by our public preaching or writing.
      We declare, moreover, that we not only reject all errors that
      militate against this doctrine and particularly those which were
      condemned by the above mentioned Synod, but that we are disposed to
      refute and contradict these, and to exert ourselves in keeping the
      Church free from such errors. And if hereafter any difficulties or
      different sentiments respecting the aforesaid doctrines should arise
      in our minds, we promise that we will neither publicly nor privately
      propose, teach, or defend the same, either by preaching or writing,
      until we have first revealed such sentiments to the consistory,
      Classis and Synod, that the same may be there examined, being ready
      always cheerfully to submit to the judgment of the consistory, Classis
      and Synod, under the penalty in case of refusal to be, by that very
      fact, suspended from our office.

      And further, if at any time the consistory, Classis or Synod, upon
      sufficient grounds of suspicion and to preserve the uniformity and
      purity of doctrine, may deem it proper to requite of us a further
      explanation of our sentiments respecting any particular article of the
      Confession of Faith, the Catechism, or the explanation of the National
      Synod, we do hereby promise to be always willing and ready to comply
      with such requisition, under the penalty above mentioned, reserving
      for ourselves, however, the right of an appeal, whenever we shall
      believe ourselves aggrieved by the sentence of the consistory, the
      Classis or the Synod, and until a decision is made upon such an
      appeal, we will acquiesce in the determination and judgment already
      passed.
