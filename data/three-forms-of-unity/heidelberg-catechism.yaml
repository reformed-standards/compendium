      - question: >-
          What is thy only comfort in life and death?
        number: 1
        answer: >-
          That I with body and soul, both in life and death,[a] am not my
          own,[b] but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ;[c] who, with
          his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins,[d] and
          delivered me from all the power of the devil;[e] and so preserves
          me[f] that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall
          from my head;[g] yea, that all things must be subservient to my
          salvation,[h] and therefore, by his Holy Spirit, He also assures me of
          eternal life,[i] and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth,
          to live unto him.[j]

        number: 4
        answer: >-
          Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40, "Thou shalt love the
          Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy
          mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first and the great
          commandment; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
          neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and
          the prophets."[a]

    questions:
      - question: >-
          Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?
        number: 6
        answer: >-
          By no means; but God created man good,[a] and after his own image,[b]
          in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his
          Creator, heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to
          glorify and praise him.[c]

      - question: >-
          Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?
        number: 7
        answer: >-
          From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, in
          Paradise;[a] hence our nature is become so corrupt, that we are all
          conceived and born in sin.[b]

            - Gen.3

    questions:
      - question: >-
          Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his
          law, that which he cannot perform?
        number: 9
        answer: >-
          Not at all;[a] for God made man capable of performing it; but man, by
          the instigation of the devil,[b] and his own wilful disobedience,[c]
          deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.

      - question: >-
          Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?
        number: 10
        answer: >-
          By no means; but is terribly displeased[a] with our original as well
          as actual sins; and will punish them in his just judgment temporally
          and eternally,[b] as he has declared, "Cursed is every one that
          continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the
          law, to do them."[c]

      - question: >-
          Is not God then also merciful?
        number: 11
        answer: >-
          God is indeed merciful,[a] but also just;[b] therefore his justice
          requires, that sin which is committed against the most high majesty of
          God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting
          punishment of body and soul.

    questions:
      - question: >-
          Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and
          eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that
          punishment, and be again received into favour?
        number: 12
        answer: >-
          God will have his justice satisfied:[a] and therefore we must make
          this full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by another.[b]

      - question: >-
          Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to
          satisfy for us?
        number: 14
        answer: >-
          None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin
          which man has committed;[a] and further, no mere creature can sustain
          the burden of God's eternal wrath against sin, so as to deliver others
          from it.[b]

      - question: >-
          What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?
        number: 15
        answer: >-
          For one who is very man, and perfectly[a] righteous;[b] and yet more
          powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God.[c]

      - question: >-
          Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?
        number: 16
        answer: >-
          Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature which
          has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin;[a] and one, who
          is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others.[b]

        number: 17
        answer: >-
          That he might, by the power of his Godhead[a] sustain in his human
          nature,[b] the burden of God's wrath;[c] and might obtain for, and
          restore to us, righteousness and life.[d]

          everlasting righteousness and salvation,[e] are freely given by God,

          Christ is very man and very God; with respect to his human nature, he
          is no more on earth;[b] but with respect to his Godhead, majesty,
          grace and spirit, he is at no time absent from us.[c]

          But if his human nature is not present, wherever his Godhead is, are
          not then these two natures in Christ separated from one another?
        number: 48
        answer: >-
          Not as all, for since the Godhead is illimitable and omnipresent,[a]
          it must necessarily follow that the same is beyond the limits of the
          human nature he assumed,[b] and yet is nevertheless in this human
          nature, and remains personally united to it.

          God speaks thus not without great cause, to-wit, not only thereby to

          blood of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the author of faith, is promised
          to them no less than to the adult;[c] they must therefore by baptism,

          It is not only to embrace with believing heart all the sufferings and

          In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed:[a] "The

          body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. After the

          is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye drink it,
          in remembrance of me. For, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
          this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come." 1 Cor.11:23-26.
          This promise is repeated by the holy apostle Paul, where he says "The

          The Lord's supper testifies to us, that we have a full pardon of all
          sin by the only sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which he himself has once
          accomplished on the cross;[a] and, that we by the Holy Ghost are
          ingrafted into Christ,[b] who, according to his human nature is now
          not on earth, but in heaven, at the right hand of God his Father,[c]
          and will there be worshipped by us.[d] But the mass teaches, that the
          living and dead have not the pardon of sins through the sufferings of
          Christ, unless Christ is also daily offered for them by the priests;
          and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and wine,
          and therefore is to be worshipped in them; so that the mass, at
          bottom, is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and
          sufferings of Jesus Christ, and an accursed idolatry.[e]

          these are forgiven them for the sake of Christ; and that their
          remaining infirmities are covered by his passion and death; and who
          also earnestly desire to have their faith more and more strengthened,
          and their lives more holy; but hypocrites, and such as turn not to God
          with sincere hearts, eat and drink judgment to themselves.[a]

          God spake all these words, saying: I am the LORD thy God, which have
          brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

          1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

          2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
          any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
          that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself
          to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
          visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
          and fourth generation of them that hate me; and showing mercy unto
          thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

          3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the
          Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

          4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
          labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the
          Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor
          thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor
          thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made
          heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
          seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed
          it.

          5. Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
          land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

          6. Thou shalt not kill.

          7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

          8. Thou shalt not steal.

          9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

          10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy
          neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox,
          nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.[a]

          It undoubtedly is,[a] for there is no sin greater or more provoking to

          Yes: either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects; or when
          necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth to the
          glory of God, and the safety of our neighbour: for such an oath is
          founded on God's word,[a] and therefore was justly used by the saints,

          swear falsely;[a] which honour is due to no creature.[b]

          Since both our body and soul are temples of the holy Ghost, he

          "And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors"; that is, be
          pleased for the sake of Christ's blood, not to impute to us poor
          sinners, our transgressions, nor that depravity, which always cleaves
          to us;[a] even as we feel this evidence of thy grace in us, that it is
          our firm resolution from the heart to forgive our neighbour.[b]

        answer: >-
          "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil"; that is,
          since we are so weak in ourselves, that we cannot stand a moment;[a]
          and besides this, since our mortal enemies, the devil,[b] the
          world,[c] and our own flesh,[d] cease not to assault us, do thou
          therefore preserve and strengthen us by the power of thy Holy Spirit,
          that we may not be overcome in this spiritual warfare,[e] but
          constantly and strenuously may resist our foes, till at last we obtain
          a complete victory.[f]

        answer: >-
          "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever";
          that is, all these we ask of thee, because thou, being our King and
          almighty, art willing and able to give us all good;[a] and all this we
          pray for, that thereby not we, but thy holy name, may be glorified for
          ever.[b]

          "Amen" signifies, it shall truly and certainly be: for my prayer is
          more assuredly heard of God, than I feel in my heart that I desire
          these things of him.[a]
