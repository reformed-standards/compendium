      Assembly at Edinburgh, February 10, 1645, Sess. 16.

      Act of the general assembly of the Kirk of Scotland, approving the
      Propositions concerning Kirk-government, and Ordination of Ministers.

      The General Assembly being most desirous and solicitous, not only of the
      establishment and preservation of the Form of Kirk-government in this
      kingdom, according to the word of God, books of Discipline, acts of
      General Assemblies, and National Covenant, but also of an uniformity in
      Kirk-government betwixt these kingdoms, now more straitly and strongly
      unite by the late Solemn League and Covenant; and considering, that as in
      former time there did, so hereafter there may arise, through the nearness
      of contagion, manifold, mischief to this kirk from a corrupt form of
      government in the kirk of England: likeas the precious opportunity of
      bringing the kirks of Christ in all the three kingdoms to an uniformity in
      Kirk-government being the happiness of the present times above the former;
      which may also, by the blessing of God, prove an effectual mean, and a
      good foundation to prepare for a safe and well-grounded pacification, by
      removing the cause from which the present pressures and bloody wars did
      originally proceed: and now the Assembly having thrice read, and
      diligently examined, the propositions (hereunto annexed) concerning the
      officers, assemblies, and government of the kirk, and concerning the
      ordination of ministers, brought unto us, as the results of the long and
      learned debates of the Assembly of Divines sitting at Westminster, and of
      the treaty of uniformity with the Commissioners of this kirk there
      residing; after mature deliberation,, and after timeous calling upon and
      warning of all, who have any exceptions against same, to make them known,
      that they might receive satisfaction; doth agree to and approve the
      propositions afore-mentioned, touching, touching Kirk-government and
      Ordination; and doth hereby authorized the Commissioners of this Assembly,
      who are to meet at Edinburgh, to agree and to conclude in the name of this
      Assembly, an uniformity betwixt the kirks in both kingdoms, in the
      afore-mentioned particulars, so soon as the same shall be ratified,
      without any substantial alteration, by an ordinance of the honourable
      Houses of the Parliament of England; which ratification shall be timely
      intimate and made known by the Commissioners of this kirk residing at
      London.  Provided always, That this act be no ways prejudicial to the
      further discussion and examination of that article which hold forth, That
      the doctor or teacher hath power of the administration of the sacraments,
      as well as the pastor; as also of the distinct rights and interests of
      presbyteries and people in the calling of ministers; but that it shall be
      free to debate and discuss these points, as God shall be pleased to give
      further light.

      Jesus Christ, upon whose shoulders the government is, whose name is called
      Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince
      of Peace;[a] of the increase of whose government and peace there shall be
      no end; who sits upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
      it, and to establish it with judgment and justice, from henceforth, even
      for ever; having all power given unto him in heaven and in earth by the
      Father, who raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand,
      far above all principalities and power, and might, and dominion, and every
      name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to
      come, and put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over
      all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that
      filleth all in all: he being ascended up far above all heavens, that he
      might fill all things, received gifts for his church, and gave officers
      necessary for the edification of his church, and perfecting of his
      saints.[b]

      There is one general church visible, held forth in the New Testament.[a]

      The ministry, oracles, and ordinances of the New Testament, are given by
      Jesus Christ to the general church visible, for the gathering and
      perfecting of it in this life, until his second coming.[b]

      Particular visible churches, members of the general church, are also held
      forth in the New Testament.[c]

      Particular churches in the primitive times were made up of visible saints,
      *viz.* of such as, being of age, professed faith in Christ, and obedience
      unto Christ, according to the rules of faith and life taught by Christ and
      his apostles; and of their children.[d]

  - name: Of the Officers of the Church
    text: |

      The officers which Christ hath appointed for the edification of his
      church, and the perfecting of the saints, are, some extraordinary, as
      apostles, evangelists, and prophets, which are ceased.

      Others ordinary and perpetual, as pastors, teachers, and other
      church-governors, and deacons.  verses:

  - name: Pastors
    text: |

      The pastor is an ordinary and perpetual officer in the church,[a]
      prophesying of the time of the gospel.[b]

      First, it belongs to his office,

      To pray for and with his flock, as the mouth of the people unto God,[c]
      where preaching and prayer are joined as several parts of the same
      office.[d] The office of the elder (that is, the pastor) is to pray for
      the sick, even in private, to which a blessing is especially promised;
      much more therefore ought he to perform this in the publick execution of
      his office, as a part thereof.[e]

      To read the Scriptures publickly; for the proof of which,

      1. That the priests and Levites in the Jewish church were trusted with the
      publick reading of the word is proved.[f]

      2. That the ministers of the gospel have as ample a charge and commission
      to dispense the word, as well as other ordinances, as the priests and
      Levites had under the law, proved, where our Saviour entitleth the
      officers of the New Testament, whom he will send forth, by the same names
      of the teachers of the Old.[g]

      Which propositions prove, that therefore (the duty being of a moral
      nature) it followeth by just consequence, that the publick reading of the
      scriptures belongeth to the pastor's office.

      To feed the flock, by preaching of the word, according to which he is to
      teach, convince, reprove, exhort, and comfort.[h]

      To catechise, which is a plain laying down the first principles of the
      oracles of God,[i] or of the doctrine of Christ, and is a part of
      preaching.

      To dispense other divine mysteries.[j]

      To administer the sacraments.[k]

      To bless the people from God[l], where, under the names of Priests and
      Levites to be continued under the gospel, are meant evangelical pastors,
      who therefore are by office to bless the people.[m]

      To take care of the poor.[n]

      And he hath also a ruling power over the flock as a pastor.[o]

  - name: Teacher or Doctor
    text: |

      The scripture doth hold out the name and title of teacher, as well as of
      the pastor.[a]

      Who is also a minister of the word, as well as the pastor, and hath power
      of administration of the sacraments.

      The Lord having given different gifts, and divers exercises according to
      these gifts, in the ministry of the word;[b] though these different gifts
      may meet in, and accordingly be exercised by, one and the same
      minister;[c] yet, where be several ministers in the same congregation,
      they may be designed to several employments, according to the different
      gifts in which each of them doth most excel.[d] And he that doth more
      excel in exposition of scripture, in teaching sound doctrine, and in
      convincing gainsayers, than he doth in application, and is accordingly
      employed therein, may be called a teacher, or doctor, (the places alleged
      by the notation of the word do prove the proposition.) Nevertheless, where
      is but one minister in a particular congregation, he is to perform, as far
      as he is able, the whole work of the ministry.[e]

      A teacher, or doctor, is of most excellent use in schools and
      universities; as of old in the schools of the prophets, and at Jerusalem,
      where Gamaliel and others taught as doctors.

      As there were in the Jewish church elders of the people joined with the
      priests and Levites in the government of the church;[a] so Christ, who
      hath instituted government, and governors ecclesiastical in the church,
      hath furnished some in his church, beside the ministers of the word, with
      gifts for government, and with commission to execute the same when called
      thereunto, who are to join with the minister in the government of the
      church.[b] Which officers reformed churches commonly call Elders.

  - name: Deacons
    text: |

      The scripture doth hold out deacons as distinct officers in the church.[a]

      Whose office is perpetual.[b] To whose office it belongs not to preach the
      word, or administer the sacraments, but to take special care in
      distributing to the necessities of the poor.[c]

  - name: Of Particular Congregations
    text: |

      It is lawful and expedient that there be fixed congregations, that is, a
      certain company of Christians to meet in one assembly ordinarily for
      publick worship. When believers multiply to such a number, that they
      cannot conveniently meet in one place, it is lawful and expedient that
      they should be divided into distinct and fixed congregations, for the
      better administration of such ordinances as belong unto them, and the
      discharge of mutual duties.[a]

      The ordinary way of dividing Christians into distinct congregations, and
      most expedient for edification, is by the respective bounds of their
      dwellings.

      First, Because they who dwell together, being bound to all kind of moral
      duties one to another, have the better opportunity thereby to discharge
      them; which moral tie is perpetual; for Christ came not to destroy the
      law, but to fulfil it.[b]

      Secondly, The communion of saints must be so ordered, as may stand with
      the most convenient use of the ordinances, and discharge of moral duties,
      without respect of persons.[c]

      Thirdly, The pastor and people must so nearly cohabit together, as that
      they may mutually perform their duties each to other with most
      conveniency.

      In this company some must be set apart to bear office.

      For officers in a single congregation, there ought to be one at the least,
      both to labour in the word and doctrine, and to rule.[a]

      It is also requisite that there should be others to join in government.[b]

      And likewise it is requisite that there be others to take special care for
      the relief of the poor. [c]

      The number of each of which is to be proportioned according to the
      condition of the congregation.

      These officers are to meet together at convenient and set times, for the
      well ordering of the affairs of that congregation, each according to his
      office.

      It is most expedient that, in these meetings, one whose office is to
      labour in the word and doctrine, do moderate in their proceedings.[d]

      The ordinances in a single congregation are, prayer, thanksgiving, and
      singing of psalms,[a] the word read, (although there follow no immediate
      explication of what is read), the word expounded and applied, catechising,
      the sacraments administered, collection made for the poor, dismissing the
      people with a blessing.

    text: |

      Christ hath instituted a government, and governors ecclesiastical in the
      church: to that purpose, the apostles did immediately receive the keys
      from the hand of Jesus Christ, and did use and exercise them in all the
      churches of the world upon all occasions.

      And Christ hath since continually furnished some in his church with gifts
      of government, and with commission to execute the same, when called
      thereunto.

      It is lawful, and agreeable to the word of God, that the church be
      governed by several sorts of assemblies, which are congregational,
      classical, and synodical.

  - name: Of the power in common of all these Assemblies
    text: |

      It is lawful, and agreeable to the word of God, that the several
      assemblies before mentioned have power to convent, and call before them,
      any person within their several bounds, whom the ecclesiastical business
      which is before them doth concern.[a]

      They have power to hear and determine such causes and differences as do
      orderly come before them.

      It is lawful, and agreeable to the word of God, that all the said
      assemblies have some power to dispense church-censures.

      Of Congregational Assemblies, that is, the Meeting of the ruling
      Officers of a particular Congregation, for the Government thereof
    text: |

      The ruling officers of a particular congregation have power,
      authoritatively, to call before them any member of the congregation, as
      they shall see just occasion.

      To enquire into the knowledge and spiritual estate of the several members
      of the congregation.

      To admonish and rebuke.

      Which three branches are proved by Heb. 13:17; 1 Thess. 5:12-13;
      Ezek. 34:4.[a]

      Authoritative suspension from the Lord's table, of a person not yet cast
      out of the church, is agreeable to the scripture:

      First, Because the ordinance itself must not be profaned.

      Secondly, Because we are charged to withdraw from those that walk
      disorderly.

      Thirdly, Because of the great sin and danger, both to him that comes
      unworthily, and also to the whole church.[b] And there was power and
      authority, under the Old Testament, to keep unclean persons from holy
      things.[c]

      The like power and authority, by way of analogy, continues under the New
      Testament.

      The ruling officers of a particular congregation have power
      authoritatively to suspend from the Lord's table a person not yet cast out
      of the church:

      First, Because those who have authority to judge of, and admit, such as
      are fit to receive the sacrament, have authority to keep back such as
      shall be found unworthy.

      Secondly, Because it is an ecclesiastical business of ordinary practice
      belonging to that congregation.

      When congregations are divided and fixed, they need all mutual help one
      from another, both in regard of their intrinsical weaknesses and mutual
      dependence, as also in regard of enemies from without.

      The scripture doth hold out a presbytery in a church.[a]

      A presbytery consisteth of ministers of the word, and such other publick
      officers as are agreeable to and warranted by the word of God to be
      church-governors, to join with the ministers in the government of the
      church.[b]

      The scripture doth hold forth, that many particular congregations may be
      under one presbyterial government.

      This proposition is proved by instances:

      1. First, Of the church of Jerusalem, which consisted of more
      congregations than one, and all these congregations were under one
      presbyterial government.

      This appeareth thus:

      First, The church of Jerusalem consisted of more congregations than one,
      as is manifest:

      1st, By the multitude of believers mentioned, in divers [places], both
      before the dispersion of the believers there, by means of the
      persecution,[c] and also after the dispersion. [d]

      2dly, By the many apostles and other preachers in the church of
      Jerusalem. And if there were but one congregation there, then each apostle
      preached but seldom;[e] which will not consist with Acts 6:2.

      3dly The diversity of languages among the believers, mentioned both in the
      second and sixth chapters of the Acts, doth argue more congregations than
      one in that church.

      Secondly, All those congregations were under one presbyterial government;
      because,

      1st, They were one church.[f]

      2dly, The elders of the church are mentioned.[g]

      3dly, The apostles did the ordinary acts of presbyters, as presbyters in
      that kirk; which proveth a presbyterial church before the dispersion, Acts
      vi.

      4thly, The several congregations in Jerusalem being one church, the elders
      of that church are mentioned as meeting together for acts of
      government;[h] which proves that those several congregations were under
      one presbyterial government.

      And whether these congregations were fixed or not fixed, in regard of
      officers or members, it is all one as to the truth of the proposition.

      Nor doth there appear any material difference betwixt the several
      congregations in Jerusalem, and the many congregations now in the ordinary
      condition of the church, as to the point of fixedness required of officers
      or members.

      Thirdly, Therefore the scripture doth hold forth, that many
      congregations may be under one presbyterial government.

      2. Second, By the instance of the church of Ephesus; for,

      First, That there were more congregations than one in the church of
      Ephesus, appears by Acts 20:31,[i] where is mention of Paul's continuance
      at Ephesus in preaching for the space of three years; and Acts
      19:18,19,20, where the special effect of the word is mentioned;[j] and
      ver. 10. and 17. of the same chapter, where is a distinction of Jews and
      Greeks;[k] and 1 Cor. 16:8,9, where is a reason of Paul's stay at
      Ephesus until Pentecost;[l] and ver. 19, where is mention of a particular
      church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla, then at Ephesus,[m] as
      appears, Acts xviii. 19,24,26.[n] All which laid together, doth prove that
      the multitude of believers did make more congregations than one in the
      church of Ephesus.

      Secondly, That there were many elders over these many congregations, as
      one flock, appeareth.[o]

      Thirdly, That these many congregations were one church, and that they were
      under one presbyterial government, appeareth.[p]

      The scripture doth hold out another sort of assemblies for the government
      of the church, beside classical and congregational, all which we call
      Synodical.[a]

      Pastors and teachers, and other church-governors, (as also other fit
      persons, when it shall be deemed expedient,) are members of those
      assemblies which we call Synodical, where they have a lawful calling
      thereunto.

      Synodical assemblies may lawfully be of several sorts, as provincial,
      national, and oecumenical.

      It is lawful, and agreeable to the word of God, that there be a
      subordination of congregational, classical, provincial, and national
      assemblies, for the government of the church.

  - name: Touching the Power of Ordination
    text: |

      Ordination is the act of a presbytery.[a]

      The power of ordering the whole work of ordination is in the whole
      presbytery, which, when it is over more congregations than one, whether
      these congregations be fixed or not fixed, in regard of officers or
      members, it is indifferent as to the point of ordination.[b]

      It is very requisite, that no single congregation, that can conveniently
      associate, do assume to itself all and sole power in ordination:

      1. Because there is no example in scripture that any single congregation,
      which might conveniently associate, did assume to itself all and sole
      power in ordination; neither is there any rule which may warrant such a
      practice.

      2. Because there is in scripture example of an ordination in a presbytery
      over divers congregations; as in the church of Jerusalem, where were many
      congregations: these many congregations were under one presbytery, and
      this presbytery did ordain.

      The preaching presbyters orderly associated, either in cities or
      neighbouring villages, are those to whom the imposition of hands doth
      appertain, for those congregations within their bounds respectively.

      1. No man ought to take upon him the office of a minister of the word
      without a lawful calling. [a]

      2. Ordination is always to be continued in the church.[b]

      3. Ordination is the solemn setting apart of a person to some publick
      church office.[c]

      4. Every minister of the word is to be ordained by imposition of hands,
      and prayer, with fasting, by these preaching presbyters to whom it doth
      belong. [d]

      5. The power of ordering the whole work of ordination is in the whole
      presbytery, which, when it is over more congregations than one, whether
      those congregations be fixed or not fixed, in regard of officers or
      members, it is indifferent as to the point of ordination.[e]

      6. It is agreeable to the word, and very expedient, that such as are to be
      ordained ministers be designed to some particular church, or other
      ministerial charge. [f]

      7. He that is to be ordained minister, must be duly qualified, both for
      life and ministerial abilities, according to the rules of the apostle.[g]

      8. He is to be examined and approved by those by whom he is to be
      ordained.[h]

      9. No man is to be ordained a minister for a particular congregation, if
      they of that congregation can shew just cause of exception against him.
      [i]

      10. Preaching presbyters orderly associated, either in cities or
      neighbouring villages, are those to whom the imposition of hands doth
      appertain, for those congregations within their bounds respectively.[j]

      11. In extraordinary cases, something extraordinary may be done, until a
      settled order may be had, yet keeping as near as possibly may be to the
      rule.[k]

      12. There is at this time (as we humbly conceive) an extraordinary
      occasion for a way of ordination for the present supply of ministers.

  - name: The Directory for the Ordination of Ministers
    text: |

      It being manifest by the word of God, that no man ought to take upon him
      the office of a minister of the gospel, until he be lawfully called and
      ordained thereunto; and that the work of ordination is to be performed
      with all due care, wisdom, gravity, and solemnity, we humbly tender these
      directions, as requisite to be observed.

      1. He that is to be ordained, being either nominated by the people, or
      otherwise commended to the presbytery, for any place, must address himself
      to the presbytery, and bring with him a testimonial of his taking the
      covenant of the three kingdoms; of his diligence and proficiency in his
      studies; what degrees he hath taken in the university, and what hath been
      the time of his abode there; and withal of his age, which is to be twenty
      four years; but especially of his life and conversation.

      2. Which being considered by the presbytery, they are to proceed to
      enquire touching the grace of God in him, and whether he be of such
      holiness of life as is requisite in a minister of the gospel; and to
      examine him touching his learning and sufficiency, and touching the
      evidences of his calling to the holy ministry; and, in particular, his
      fair and direct calling to that place.

      #### The Rules for Examination are these:

      (1.) That the party examined be dealt withal in a brotherly way, with
      mildness of spirit, and with special respect to the gravity, modesty, and
      quality of every one.

      (2.) He shall be examined touching his skill in the original tongues, and
      his trial to be made by reading the Hebrew and Greek Testaments, and
      rendering some portion of some into Latin; and if he be defective in them,
      enquiry shall be made more strictly after his other learning, and whether
      he hath skill in logick and philosophy.

      (3.) What authors in divinity he hath read, and is best acquainted with;
      and trial shall be made in his knowledge of the grounds of religion, and
      of his ability to defend the orthodox doctrine contained in them against
      all unsound and erroneous opinions, especially these of the present age;
      of his skill in the sense and meaning of such places of scripture as shall
      be proposed unto him, in cases of conscience, and in the chronology of the
      scripture, and the ecclesiastical history.

      (4.) If he hath not before preached in publick with approbation of such as
      are able to judge, he shall, at a competent time assigned him, expound
      before the presbytery such a place of scripture as shall be given him.

      (5.) He shall also, within a competent time, frame a discourse in Latin
      upon such a common-place or controversy in divinity as shall be assigned
      to him, and exhibit to the presbytery such theses as express the sum
      thereof, and maintain a dispute upon them.

      (6.) He shall preach before the people, the presbytery, or some of the
      ministers of the word appointed by them, being present.

      (7.) The proportion of his gifts in relation to the place unto which he is
      called shall be considered.

      (8.) Beside the trial of his gifts in preaching, he shall undergo an
      examination in the premises two several days, and more, if the presbytery
      shall judge it necessary.

      (9.) And as for him that hath formerly been ordained a minister, and is to
      be removed to another charge, he shall bring a testimonial of his
      ordination, and of his abilities and conversation, whereupon his fitness
      for that place shall be tried by his preaching there, and (if it shall be
      judged necessary) by a further examination of him.

      3. In all which he being approved, he is to be sent to the church where he
      is to serve, there to preach three several days and to converse with the
      people, that they may have trial of his gifts for their edification, and
      may have time and occasion to enquire into, and the better to know, his
      life and conversation.

      4. In the last of these three days appointed for the trial of his gifts in
      preaching, there shall be sent from the presbytery to the congregation a
      publick intimation in writing, which shall be publickly read before the
      people, and after affixed to the church-door, to signify that such a day a
      competent number of the members of that congregation, nominated by
      themselves, shall appear before the presbytery, to give their consent and
      approbation to such a man to be their minister; or otherwise, to put in,
      with all Christian discretion and meekness, what exceptions they have
      against him. And if, upon the day appointed, there be no just exception
      against him, but the people give their consent, then the presbytery shall
      proceed to ordination.

      5. Upon the day appointed for ordination, which is to be performed in that
      church where he that is to be ordained is to serve, a solemn fast shall be
      kept by the congregation, that they may the more earnestly join in prayer
      for a blessing upon the ordinances of Christ, and the labours of his
      servant for their good. The presbytery shall come to the place, or at
      least three or four ministers of the word shall be sent thither from the
      presbytery; of which one appointed by the presbytery shall preach to the
      people concerning the office and duty of ministers of Christ, and how the
      people ought to receive them for their work's sake.

      6. After the sermon, the minister who hath preached shall, in the face of
      the congregation, demand of him who is now to be ordained, concerning how
      faith in Christ Jesus, and his persuasion of the truth of the reformed
      religion, according to the scriptures; his sincere intentions and ends in
      desiring to enter into this calling; his diligence in praying, reading,
      meditation, preaching, ministering the sacraments, discipline, and doing
      all ministerial duties towards his charge; his zeal and faithfulness in
      maintaining the truth of the gospel, and unity of the church, against
      error and schism; his care that himself and his family may be unblameable,
      and examples to the flock; his willingness and humility, in meekness of
      spirit, to submit unto the admonitions of his brethren, and discipline of
      the church; and his resolution to continue in his duty against all trouble
      and persecution.

      7. In all which having declared himself, professed his willingness, and
      promised his endeavours, by the help of God; the minister likewise shall
      demand of the people concerning their willingness to receive and
      acknowledge him as the minister of Christ; and to obey and submit unto
      him, as having rule over them in the Lord; and to maintain, encourage, and
      assist him in all the parts of his office.

      8. Which being mutually promised by the people, the presbytery, or the
      ministers sent from them for ordination, shall solemnly set him apart to
      the office and work of the ministry, by laying their hands on him, which
      is to be accompanied with a short prayer or blessing, to this effect:

      "Thankfully acknowledging the great mercy of God in sending Jesus
      Christ for the redemption of his people; and for his ascension to the
      right hand of God the Father, and thence pouring out his Spirit, and
      giving gifts to men, apostles, evangelists, prophets, pastors, and
      teachers; for the gathering and building up of his church; and for fitting
      and inclining this man to this great work: to entreat him to fit him with
      his Holy Spirit, to give him (who in his name we thus set apart to this
      holy service) to fulfil the work of his ministry in all things, that he
      may both save himself, and his people committed to his charge."

      9. This or the like form of prayer and blessing being ended, let the
      minister who preached briefly exhort him to consider of the greatness of
      his office and work, the danger of negligence both to himself and his
      people, the blessing which will accompany his faithfulness in this life,
      and that to come; and withal exhort the people to carry themselves to him,
      as to their minister in the Lord, according to their solemn promise made
      before. And so by prayer commending both him and his flock to the grace of
      God, after singing of a psalm, let the assembly be dismissed with a
      blessing.

      10. If a minister be designed to a congregation, who hath been formerly
      ordained presbyter according to the form of ordination which hath been in
      the church of England, which we hold for substance to be valid, and not to
      be disclaimed by any who have received it; then, there being a cautious
      proceeding in matters of examination, let him be admitted without any new
      ordination.

      11. And in case any person already ordained minister in Scotland, or in
      any other reformed church, be designed to another congregation in England,
      he is to bring from that church to the presbytery here, within which that
      congregation is, a sufficient testimonial of his ordination, of his life
      and conversation while he lived with them, and of the causes of his
      removal; and to undergo such a trial of his fitness and sufficiency, and
      to have the same course held with him in other particulars, as is set down
      in the rule immediately going before, touching examination and admission.

      12. That records be carefully kept in the several presbyteries, of the
      names of the persons ordained, with their testimonials, the time and place
      of their ordination, of the presbyters who did impose hands upon them, and
      of the charge to which they are appointed.

      13. That no money or gift, of what kind soever, shall be received from the
      person to be ordained, or from any on his behalf, for ordination, or ought
      else belonging to it, by any of the presbytery, or any appertaining to any
      of them, upon what pretence soever.

      Thus far of ordinary Rules, and course of Ordination, in the ordinary
      way; that which concerns the extraordinary way, requisite to be now
      practised, followeth
    text: |

      1. In these present exigencies, while we cannot have any presbyteries
      formed up to their whole power and work, and that many ministers are to be
      ordained for the service of the armies and navy, and to many congregations
      where there is no minister at all; and where (by reason of the publick
      troubles) the people cannot either themselves enquire and find out one who
      may be a faithful minister for them, or have any with safety sent unto
      them, for such a solemn trial as was before mentioned in the ordinary
      rules; especially, when there can be no presbytery near unto them, to whom
      they may address themselves, or which may come or send to them a fit man
      to be ordained in that congregation, and for that people; and yet
      notwithstanding, it is requisite that ministers be ordained for them by
      some, who, being set apart themselves for the work of the ministry, have
      power to join in the setting apart others, who are found fit and worthy.
      In those cases, until, by God's blessing, the aforesaid difficulties may
      be in some good measure removed, let some godly ministers, in or about the
      city of London, be designed by publick authority, who, being associated,
      may ordain ministers for the city and the vicinity, keeping as near to the
      ordinary rules fore-mentioned as possibly they may; and let this
      association be for no other intent or purpose, but only for the work of
      ordination.

      2. Let the like association be made by the same authority in great towns,
      and the neighbouring parishes in the several counties, which are at the
      present quiet and undisturbed, to do the like for the parts adjacent.

      3. Let such as are chosen, or appointed for the service of the armies or
      navy, be ordained, as aforesaid, by the associated ministers of London, or
      some others in the country.

      4. Let them do the like, when any man shall duly and lawfully be
      recommended to them for the ministry of any congregation, who cannot enjoy
      liberty to have a trial of his parts and abilities, and desire the help of
      such ministers so associated, for the better furnishing of them with such
      a person as by them shall be judged fit for the service of that church and
      people.
