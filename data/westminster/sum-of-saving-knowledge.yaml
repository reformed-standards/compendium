    text: |
        The Sum Of Saving Knowledge may be taken up in those four
        heads:

        1. The woeful condition wherein all men are by nature, through
        breaking of the Covenant of Works.
        2. The remedy provided for the elect in Jesus Christ by the
        Covenant of Grace.
        3. The means appointed to make them partakers of this
        covenant.
        4. The blessings which are effectually conveyed unto the elect
        by these means.

        Which four heads are set down each of them in some few
        propositions.

        ### HEAD I - Our woeful condition by nature, through breaking the Covenant of Works.
        *O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself.* -Hosea 13:9

        I. The almighty and eternal God; the Father, the Son, and the
        Holy Ghost, three distinct persons in the one and the same
        undivided Godhead, equally infinite in all perfections; did,
        before time, most wisely decree, for his own glory, whatsoever
        cometh to pass in time: and doth most holily and infallibly
        execute all his decrees, without being partaker of the sin of
        any creature.

        II. This God, in six days, made all things of nothing, very
        good in their own kind: in special, he made all the angels
        holy; and he made our first parents, Adam and Eve, the root of
        mankind, both upright and able to keep the law written in
        their heart. Which law they were naturally bound to obey under
        pain of death; but God was not bound to reward their service,
        till he entered into a covenant or contract with them, and
        their posterity in them, to give them eternal life, upon
        condition of perfect personal obedience; withal threatening
        death in case they should fail. This is the Covenant of Works.

        III. Both angels and men were subject to the change of their
        own freewill, as experience proved, (God having reserved to
        himself the incommunicable property of being naturally
        unchangeable:) for many angels of their own accord fell by sin
        from their first estate, and became devils. Our first parents,
        being enticed by Satan, one of these devils speaking in a
        serpent, did break the Covenant of Works, in eating the
        forbidden fruit; whereby they, and their posterity, being in
        their loins, as branches in the root, and comprehended in the
        same covenant with them, became not only liable to eternal
        death, but also lost all ability to please God; yea, did
        become by nature enemies to God, and to all spiritual good,
        and inclined only to evil continually. This is our Original
        Sin, the bitter root of all our actual transgressions, in
        thought, word, and deed.

        ### HEAD II. - The remedy provided in Jesus Christ for the elect by the Covenant of Grace.
        *O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine
        help.* -Hosea 13:9

        I. Albeit man, having brought himself into this woeful
        condition, be neither able to help himself, nor willing to be
        helped by God out of it, but rather inclined to lie still,
        insensible of it, till he perish; yet God, for the glory of
        his rich grace, hath revealed in his word a way to save
        sinners; viz., by faith in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of
        God; by virtue of, and according to the tenor of the Covenant
        of Redemption, made and agreed upon between God the Father and
        God the Son, in the council of the Trinity, before the world
        began.

        II. The sum of the Covenant of Redemption is this: God having
        freely chosen unto life a certain number of lost mankind; for
        the glory of his rich grace, did give them, before the world
        began, unto God the Son, appointed Redeemer; that, upon
        condition he would humble himself so far as to assume the
        human nature, of a soul and a body, unto personal union with
        his divine nature, and submit himself to the law, as surety
        for them, and satisfy justice for them, by giving obedience in
        their name, even unto the suffering of the cursed death of the
        cross, he should ransom and redeem them all from sin and
        death, and purchase unto them righteousness and eternal life,
        with all saving graces leading thereunto, to be effectually,
        by means of his own appointment, applied in due time to every
        one of them. This condition the Son of God (who is Jesus
        Christ our Lord) did accept before the world began, and in the
        fulness of time came into the world, was born of the Virgin
        Mary, subjected himself to the law, and completely paid the
        ransom on the cross: But by virtue of the foresaid bargain,
        made before the world began, he is in all ages, since the fall
        of Adam, still upon the work of applying actually the
        purchased benefits unto the elect; and that he doth by way of
        entertaining a covenant of free grace and reconciliation with
        them, through, faith in himself; by which covenant, he makes
        over to every believer a right and interest to himself, and to
        all his blessings.

        III. For the accomplishment of this Covenant of Redemption,
        and making the elect partakers of the benefits thereof in the
        Covenant of Grace, Christ Jesus was clad with the threefold
        office of Prophet, Priest, and King: made a Prophet, to reveal
        all saving knowledge to his people, and to persuade them to
        believe and obey the same; made a Priest, to offer up himself
        a sacrifice once for them all, and to intercede continually
        with the Father, for making their persons and services
        acceptable to him; and made a King, to subdue them to himself,
        to feed and rule them by his own appointed ordinances, and to
        defend them from their enemies.

        ### HEAD III. - The outward means appointed to make the elect partakers of this covenant, and all the rest that are called, to be inexcusable.
        *Many are called.* -Matthew 22:14

        I. The outward means and ordinances, for making men partakers
        of the Covenant of Grace, are so wisely dispensed, as that the
        elect shall be infallibly converted and saved by them; and the
        reprobate, among whom they are, not to be justly stumbled. The
        means are especially these four:
        1. The word of God.
        2. The sacraments.
        3. Kirk-government.
        4. Prayer.
        In the word of God preached by sent messengers, the Lord makes
        offer of grace to all sinners, upon condition of faith in
        Jesus Christ; and whosoever do confess their sin, accept of
        Christ offered, and submit themselves to his ordinances, he
        will have both them and their children received into the
        honour and privileges of the Covenant of Grace. By the
        sacraments, God will have the covenant sealed for confirming
        the bargain on the foresaid condition. By kirk-government, he
        will have them hedged in, and helped forward unto the keeping
        of the covenant. And by prayer, he will have his own glorious
        grace, promised in the covenant, to be daily drawn forth,
        acknowledged, and employed. All which means are followed
        either really, or in profession only, according to the quality
        of the covenanters, as they are true or counterfeit believers.

        II. The Covenant of Grace, set down in the Old Testament
        before Christ came, and in the New since he came, is one and
        the same in substance, albeit different in outward
        administration: For the covenant in the Old Testament, being
        sealed with the sacraments of Circumcision and the Paschal
        Lamb, did set forth Christ's death to come, and the benefits
        purchased thereby, under the shadow of bloody sacrifices, and
        sundry ceremonies: but since Christ came, the covenant being
        sealed by the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
        doth clearly hold forth Christ already crucified before our
        eyes, victorious over death and the grave, and gloriously
        ruling heaven and earth, for the good of his own people.

        ### HEAD IV. - The blessings which are effectually conveyed by these means to the Lord's elect, or chosen ones.
        *Many are called, but few are chosen.* -Matthew 22:14

        I. BY these outward ordinances, as our Lord makes the
        reprobate inexcusable, so, by the power of his Spirit, he
        applies unto the elect, effectually, all saving graces
        purchased to them in the Covenant of Redemption, and maketh a
        change in their persons. In particular,
        1. He doth convert or regenerate them, by giving spiritual
        life to them, in opening their understandings, renewing their
        wills, affections, and, faculties, for giving spiritual
        obedience to his commands.
        2. He gives them saving faith, by making them, in the sense of
        deserved condemnation, to give their consent heartily to the
        Covenant of Grace, and to embrace Jesus Christ unfeignedly.
        3. He gives them repentance, by making them, with godly
        sorrow, in the hatred of sin, and love of righteousness, turn
        from all iniquity to the service of God.
        4. And, He sanctifies them, by making them go on and persevere
        in faith and spiritual obedience to the law of God, manifested
        by fruitfulness in all duties, and doing good works, as God
        offereth occasion.

        II. Together with this inward change of their persons, God
        changes also their state: for, so soon as they are brought by
        faith into the covenant of grace,
        1. He justifies them, by imputing unto them that perfect
        obedience which Christ gave to the law, and the satisfaction
        also which upon the cross Christ gave unto justice in their
        name.
        2. He reconciles them, and makes them friends to God, who were
        before enemies to God.
        3. He adopts them, that they shall be no more children of
        Satan, but children of God, enriched with all spiritual
        privileges of his sons.
        4. And, (last of all,) after their warfare in this life is
        ended, he perfects the holiness and blessedness, first of
        their souls at their death, and then both of their souls and
        their bodies, being joyfully joined together again in the
        resurrection, at the day of his glorious coming to judgment,
        when all the wicked shall be sent away to hell, with Satan
        whom they have served: but Christ's own chosen and redeemed
        ones, true believers, students of holiness, shall remain with
        himself for ever, in the state of glorification.
        - - -
  - name: THE PRACTICAL USE OF SAVING KNOWLEDGE,
    text: |
        Contained in Scripture, and holden forth briefly in the
        foresaid Confession of Faith and Catechisms.

        The chief general use of Christian doctrine is, to convince a
        man of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment, John 16:8,
        partly by the law or covenant of works, that he may be humbled
        and become penitent; and partly by the gospel or covenant of
        grace, that he may become an unfeigned believer in Jesus
        Christ, and be strengthened in his faith upon solid grounds
        and warrants, and give evidence of the truth of his faith by
        good fruits, and so be saved.

        The sum of the covenant of works, or of the law, is this: "If
        thou do all that is commanded, and not fail in any point, thou
        shalt be saved: but if thou fail, thou shalt die." Romans
        10:5; Galatians 3:10, 12. 

        The sum of the gospel, or covenant of grace and
        reconciliation, is this: "If thou flee from deserved wrath to
        the true Redeemer Jesus Christ, (who is able to save to the
        uttermost all that come to God through him,) thou shalt not
        perish, but "have eternal life." Romans 10:8-9, 11.

        For convincing a man of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment
        by the law, or covenant of works, let these scriptures, among
        many more, be made use of.

        ### I. For convincing a man of sin by the law, consider Jeremiah 17:9-10. 

        Ver. 9. The heart is deceitful above all things, and
        desperately wicked: who can know it? Ver. 10. I the Lord
        search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man
        according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
        doings.

        Here the Lord teacheth these two things:

        1. That the fountain of all our miscarriage, and actual
        sinning against God, is in the heart, which comprehendeth the
        mind, will, affections, and all the powers of the soul, as
        they are corrupted and defiled with original sin; the mind
        being not only ignorant and incapable of saving truth, but
        also full of error and enmity against God; and the will and
        affections being obstinately disobedient unto all God's
        directions, and bent toward that only which is evil: The heart
        (saith he) is deceitful above all things, and desperately
        wicked; yea, and unsearchably wicked, so that no man can know
        it; and Genesis 6:5, Every imagination of the thoughts of
        man's heart is only evil continually, saith the Lord, whose
        testimony we must trust in this and all other matters; and
        experience also may teach us, that, till God make us deny
        ourselves, we never look to God in any thing, but fleshly
        self-interest alone doth rule us, and move all the wheels of
        our actions.

        2. That the Lord bringeth our original sin, or wicked
        inclination, with all the actual fruits thereof, unto
        reckoning before his judgment-seat ; "For he searcheth the
        heart, and trieth the reins, to give every man according to
        his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings."

        Hence let every man reason thus:

        "What God and my guilty conscience beareth witness of, I am
        convinced that it is true: 
        "But God and my guilty conscience beareth witness, that my
        heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked;
        and that all the imaginations of my heart, by nature, are only
        evil continually: 
        "Therefore I am convinced that this is true."

        Thus a man may be convinced of sin by the law.

        ### II. For convincing a man of righteousness by the law, consider Galatians 3:10.

        As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
        for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in
        all things which are written in the book of the law to do
        them.

        Here the apostle teacheth us three things:

        1. That by reason of our natural sinfulness, the impossibility
        of any man's being justified by the works of the law is so
        certain, that whosoever do seek justification by the works of
        the law, are liable to the curse of God for breaking of the
        law; For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
        curse, saith he.

        2. That, unto the perfect fulfilling of the law, the keeping
        of one or two of the precepts, or doing of some, or of all
        duties (if it were possible) for a time, is not sufficient;
        for the law requireth, that a man continue in all things
        which, are written in the book of the law to do them.

        3. That, because no man can come up to this perfection, every
        man by nature is under the curse; for the law saith, Cursed is
        every one that continueth not in all things which are written
        in the book of the law to do them.

        Now, to be under the curse, comprehendeth all the displeasure
        of God, with the danger of the breaking forth more and more of
        his wrath upon soul and body, both in this life, and after
        death perpetually, if grace do not prevent the full execution
        thereof.

        Hence let every man reason thus: 

        "Whosoever, according to the covenant of works, is liable to
        the curse of God for breaking the law, times and ways out of
        number, cannot be justified, or find righteousness by the
        works of the law:
        "But I, (may every man say,) according to the covenant of
        works, am liable to the curse of God, for breaking the law
        times and ways without number:
        "Therefore I cannot be justified, or have righteousness by the
        works of the law."

        Thus may a man be convinced of righteousness, that it is not
        to be had by his own works, or by the law.

        ### III. For convincing a man of judgment by the law, consider 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10.

        Ver. 7. The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his
        mighty angels, Ver. 8. In flaming fire, taking vengeance on
        them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our
        Lord Jesus Christ: Ver. 9. Who shall be punished with
        everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and
        from the glory of his power; Ver. 10. When he shall come to be
        glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that
        believe.

        Wherein we are taught, that our Lord Jesus, who now offers to
        be Mediator for them who believe in him, shall, at the last
        day, come armed with flaming fire, to judge, condemn, and
        destroy all them who have not believed God, have not received
        the offer of grace made in the gospel, nor obeyed the doctrine
        thereof; but remain in their natural state, under the law or
        covenant of works.

        Hence let every man reason thus:

        "What the righteous Judge hath forewarned me shall be done at
        the last day, I am sure is just judgment:
        "But the righteous Judge hath forewarned me, that if I do not
        believe God in time, and obey not the doctrine of the gospel,
        I shall be secluded from his presence and his glory at the
        last day, and be tormented in soul and body for ever:
        "Therefore I am convinced that this is a just judgment:
        "And I have reason to thank God heartily, who hath forewarned
        me to flee from the wrath which is to come."

        Thus every man may be, by the law or covenant of works,
        convinced of judgment, if he shall continue under the covenant
        of works, or shall not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

        ### IV. For convincing a man of sin, righteousness, and judgment, by the gospel.

        As for convincing a man of sin, and righteousness, and
        judgment, by the gospel, or covenant of grace, he must
        understand three things:

        1. That not believing in Jesus
        Christ, or refusing of the covenant of grace offered in him,
        is a greater and more dangerous sin than all other sins
        against the law; because the hearers of the gospel, not
        believing in Christ, do reject God's mercy in Christ, the only
        way of freedom from sin and wrath, and will not yield to be
        reconciled to God.

        2. Next, he must understand, that perfect
        remission of sin, and true righteousness, is to be had only by
        faith in Jesus; because God requireth no other conditions but
        faith; and testifies from heaven, that he is well pleased to
        justify sinners upon this condition,

        3. He must understand,
        that upon righteousness received by faith, judgment shall
        follow, on the one hand, to the destroying of the works of the
        devil in the believer, and to the perfecting of the work of
        sanctification in him, with power: and that, upon refusing to
        take righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ, judgment shall
        follow, on the other hand, to the condemnation of the
        misbeliever, and destroying of him with Satan and his servants
        for ever.

        For this end, let these passages of Scripture, among many
        others, serve to make the greatness of the sin of not
        believing in Christ appear; or, to make the greatness of the
        sin of refusing of the covenant of grace offered to us in the
        offering of Christ unto us appear; let the fair offer of grace
        be looked upon as it is made, Isaiah 55:3. Incline your ear,
        and come unto me, (saith the Lord:) hear, and your soul shall
        live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even
        the sure mercies of David. That is, If ye will believe me, and
        be reconciled to me, I will, by covenant, give unto you
        Christ, and all saving graces in him: repeated Acts 8:34. 

        Again, consider, that this general offer in substance is
        equivalent to a special offer made to every one in particular;
        as appeareth by the apostle's making use of it, Acts 16:31.
        Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and
        thy house. The reason of which offer is given, John 3:16.
        For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
        Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
        have everlasting life.

        Seeing then this great salvation is offered in the Lord Jesus,
        whosoever believeth not in him, but looks for happiness some
        other way, what doth he else but observe lying vanities, and
        forsake his own mercy, which he might have had in Christ?
        Jonah 2:8-9. What doth he else but blaspheme God in his
        heart? as it is said, 1 John 5:10-11. He that believeth not
        God, hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record
        that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God
        hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.
        And that no sin against the law is like unto this sin, Christ
        testifies, John 15:23. If I had not come and spoken unto
        them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for
        their sin. This may convince a man of the greatness of this
        sin of not, believing in Christ.

        ### V. For convincing a man of righteousness to be had only by faith in Jesus Christ, consider how, Romans 10:3-4,

        It is said, that the Jews, being ignorant of God's
        righteousness, and going about to establish their own
        righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
        righteousness of God, (and so they perished.) For Christ is
        the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
        believeth. And Acts 13:39. By him all that believe are
        justified from all things, from which ye could not be
        justified by the law of Moses. And 1 John 1:7. The blood of
        Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

        For convincing a man of judgment, if a man embrace this
        righteousness, consider 1 John 3:8. For this purpose the
        Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of
        the devil. And Hebrews 9:14. How much more shall the blood of
        Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without
        spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve
        the living God?

        But if a man embrace not this righteousness, his doom is
        pronounced, John 3:18-19. He that believeth not is
        condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of
        the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation,
        that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness
        rather than light.

        Hence let the penitent, desiring to believe, reason thus:

        "What doth suffice to convince all the elect in the world of
        the greatness of the sin of not believing in Christ, or
        refusing to flee to him for relief from sins done against the
        law, and from wrath due thereto; and what sufficeth to
        convince them that righteousness and eternal life is to be had
        by faith in Jesus Christ, or by consenting to the covenant of
        grace in him; and what sufficeth to convince them of judgment
        to be exercised by Christ, for destroying the works of the
        devil in the man, and sanctifying and saving all that believe
        in him; may suffice to convince me also:

        "But what the Spirit hath said, in these or other like
        scriptures, sufficeth to convince the elect world of the
        foresaid sin, and righteousness, and judgment:

        "Therefore what the Spirit hath said, in these and other like
        scriptures, serveth to convince me thereof also." 

        Whereupon let the penitent desiring to believe take with him
        words, and say heartily to the Lord, Seeing thou sayest, Seek
        ye my face; my soul answereth unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will
        I seek. I have hearkened unto the offer of an everlasting
        covenant of all saving mercies to be had in Christ, and I do
        heartily embrace thy offer. Lord, let it be a bargain; Lord, I
        believe; help my unbelief: Behold, I give myself to thee, to
        serve thee in all things for ever; and I hope thy right hand
        shall save me: the Lord will perfect that which concerneth me:
        thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever; forsake not the works of
        thine own hands.

        Thus may a man be made an unfeigned believer in Christ.

        ### VI. For strengthening the man's faith who hath agreed unto the Covenant of Grace:

        Because many true believers are, weak, and do much doubt if
        ever they shall be sure of the soundness of their own faith
        and effectual calling, or made certain of their justification
        and salvation, when they see that many, who profess faith, are
        found to deceive themselves; let us see how every believer may
        be made strong in the faith, and sure of his own election and
        salvation upon solid grounds, by sure warrants, and true
        evidences of faith. To this end, among many other scriptures,
        take these following:-

        I. For laying solid grounds of faith, consider 2 Peter i. 10.
        Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
        calling and election sure; for if ye do these things ye shall,
        never fall.

        In which words, the apostle teacheth us these four things, for
        help and direction how to be made strong in the faith:

        1. That such as believe in Christ Jesus, and are fled to him
        for relief from sin and wrath, albeit they be weak in the
        faith, yet they are indeed children of the same Father with
        the apostles; for so he accounteth of them, while he calleth
        them brethren.

        2. That albeit we be not sure, for the time, of our effectual
        calling and election, yet we may be made sure of both, if we
        use diligence; for this he presupposeth, saying, Give
        diligence to make your calling and election sure.

        3. That we must not be discouraged, when we see many seeming
        believers prove rotten branches, and make defection; but we
        must the rather take the better heed to ourselves: Wherefore
        the rather, brethren, (saith he,) give all diligence.

        4. That the way to be sure both of our effectual calling and
        election, is to make sure work of our faith, by laying the
        grounds of it solidly, and bringing forth the fruits of our
        faith in new obedience constantly: for if ye do these things,
        (saith he,) ye shall never "fall;" understanding by these
        things, what he had said of sound faith, Ver. 1-4, and
        what he had said of the bringing out of the fruits of faith,
        Ver. 5-9.

        II. To this same purpose, consider Rom. 8:1. There is
        therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
        Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
        Ver. 2. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
        made me free from the law of sin and death. Ver. 3. For what
        the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
        God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
        for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; Ver. 4. That the
        righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
        not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

        Wherein the apostle teacheth us these four things, for laying
        of the ground of faith solidly:

        1. That every one is a true believer, who, in the sense of his
        sin, and fear of God's wrath, doth flee for full relief from
        both unto Jesus Christ alone, as the only Mediator and all-
        sufficient Redeemer of men; and, being fled to Christ, doth
        strive against his own flesh, or corrupt inclination of
        nature, and studieth to follow the rule of God's Spirit, set
        down in his word: for the man, whom the apostle doth here
        bless as a true believer, is a man in Christ Jesus, who doth
        not walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

        2. That all such persons as are fled to Christ, and do strive
        against sin, howsoever they may be possibly exercised under
        the sense of wrath, and fear of condemnation, yet they are in
        no danger; for there is no condemnation (saith he) to them
        that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but
        after the Spirit.

        3. That albeit the apostle himself, (brought in here for
        example's cause,) and all other true believers in Christ, be
        by nature under the law of sin and death, or under the
        covenant of works, (called the law of sin and death, because
        it bindeth sin and death upon us, till Christ set us free;)
        yet the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, or the
        covenant of grace, (so called, because it doth enable and
        quicken a man to a spiritual life through Christ,) doth set
        the apostle, and all true believers, free from the covenant of
        works, or the law of sin and death: so that every man may say
        with him, The law of the Spirit of life, or the covenant of
        grace, hath made me free from the law of sin and death, or
        covenant of works.

        4. That the fountain and first ground, from whence our freedom
        from the curse of the law, doth flow, is the covenant of
        redemption, passed betwixt God and God the Son as incarnate,
        wherein Christ takes the curse of the law upon him for sin,
        that the believer, who could not otherwise be delivered from
        the covenant of works, may be delivered from it. And this
        doctrine the apostle holdeth forth in these four branches:
        	1. That it was utterly impossible for the law, or the
        	covenant of works, to bring righteousness and life to a
        	sinner, because it was weak,
        	2. That this weakness and inability of the law, or covenant
        	of works, is not the fault of the law, but the fault of
        	sinful flesh, which is neither able to pay the penalty of
        	sin, nor to give perfect obedience to the law, (presuppose
        	bygone sins were forgiven:) The law was weak (saith he)
        	through, the flesh.
        	3. That the righteousness and salvation of sinners, which was
        	impossible to be brought about by the law, is brought to pass
        	by sending God's own Son, Jesus Christ, in the flesh, in
        	whose flesh sin is condemned and punished, for making
        	satisfaction in the behalf of the elect, that they might be
        	set free.
        	4. That by his means the law loseth nothing, because the
        	righteousness of the law is best fulfilled this way; first,
        	by Christ's giving perfect active obedience in our name unto
        	it in all things; next, by his paying in our name the penalty
        	due to our sins in his death: and, lastly, by his working of
        	sanctification in us, who are true believers, who strive to
        	give new obedience unto the law, and walk not after the
        	flesh, but after the Spirit.

  - name: WARRANTS TO BELIEVE.
    text: |

        For building our confidence upon this solid ground, these four
        Warrants and special Motives to believe in Christ may serve.

        The first whereof is God's hearty invitation, holden forth,
        Isaiah 55: l-5.

        Ver. 1. Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
        and he that hath no money: come ye, buy and eat; yea, come,
        buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Ver. 2.
        Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and
        your labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently
        unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
        delight itself in fatness. Ver. 3. Incline your ear, and come
        unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an
        everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
        Ver. 4. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people,
        a leader and commander to the people, etc.

        Here (after setting down the precious ransom of our redemption
        by the sufferings of Christ, and the rich blessings purchased
        to us thereby, in the two former chapters) the Lord, in this
        chapter,

        1. Maketh open offer of Christ and his grace, by proclamation
        of a free and gracious market of righteousness and salvation,
        to be had through Christ to every soul, without exception,
        that truly desires to be saved from sin and wrath: Ho, every
        one that thirsteth, saith he.
        2. He inviteth all sinners, that for any reason stand at a
        distance from God, to come and take from him riches of grace,
        running in Christ as a river, to wash away sin, and to slocken
        wrath: Come ye to the waters, saith he.
        3. Lest any should stand aback in the sense of his own
        sinfulness or unworthiness, and inability to do any good, the
        Lord calleth upon such persons in special, saying, He that
        hath no money, come.
        4. He craveth no more of his merchant, but that he be pleased
        with the wares offered, which are grace, and more grace; and
        that he heartily consent unto, and embrace this offer of
        grace, that so he may close a bargain, and a formal covenant
        with God: Come, buy without money, (saith he,) come, eat: that
        is, consent to have, and take unto you all saving graces; make
        the wares your own; possess them, and make use of all
        blessings in Christ; whatsoever maketh for your spiritual life
        and comfort, use and enjoy it freely, without paying anything
        for it: Come, buy wine and milk without money, and without
        price, saith he.
        5. Because the Lord knoweth how much we are inclined to seek
        righteousness and life by our own performances and
        satisfaction; to have righteousness and life as it were by the
        way of works; and how loath we are to embrace Christ Jesus,
        and to take life by way of free grace through Jesus Christ,
        upon the terms whereupon it is offered to us; therefore the
        Lord lovingly calls us off this our crooked and unhappy way
        with a gentle and timeous admonition, giving us to understand,
        that we shall but lose our labour in this our way: Wherefore
        do you spend your money (saith he) for that which is not
        bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth, not?
        6. The Lord promiseth to us solid satisfaction in the way of
        betaking ourselves unto the grace of Christ, even true
        contentment, and fulness of spiritual pleasure, saying,
        Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and
        let your soul delight itself in fatness.
        7. Because faith cometh by hearing, he calleth for audience
        unto the explication of the offer, and calleth for believing
        of, and listening unto the truth, which is able to beget the
        application of saving faith, and to draw the soul to trust in
        God: Incline your ear, and come unto me, saith he. To which
        end, the Lord promises, that this offer being received, shall
        quicken the dead sinner; and that, upon the welcoming of this
        offer, he will close the covenant of grace with the man that
        shall consent unto it, even an indissolvable covenant of
        perpetual reconciliation and peace. Hear, and your soul shall
        live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you. Which
        covenant, he declareth, shall be in substance the assignation,
        and the making over, of all the saving graces which David (who
        is Jesus Christ, Acts 13:34,) hath bought for us in the
        covenant of redemption: I will make a covenant with you,
        (saith he,) even the sure mercies of David. By sure mercies,
        he means saving graces, such as are righteousness, peace, and
        joy in the Holy Ghost, adoption, sanctification, and
        glorification, and whatsoever belongs to godliness and life
        eternal.
        8. To confirm and assure us of the real grant of these saving
        mercies, and to persuade us of the reality of the covenant
        betwixt God and the believer of this word, the Father hath
        made a fourfold gift of his eternal and only begotten Son:

        First, To be incarnate and born for our sake, of the seed of
        David his type; for which cause he is called here, and Acts
        13:34, David, the true and everlasting King of Israel. This is
        the great gift of God to man, John 4:10. And here, I have
        given him to be David, (or born of David,) to the people.

        Secondly, He hath made a gift of Christ to be a witness to the
        people, both of the sure and saving mercies granted to the
        redeemed in the covenant of redemption; and also of the
        Father's willingness and purpose to apply them, and to make
        them fast in the covenant of reconciliation made with such as
        embrace the offer: I have given him (saith the Lord here) to
        be a witness to the people. And truly he is a sufficient
        witness in this matter in many respects:
        1. Because he is one of the blessed Trinity, and party-
        contractor for us, in the covenant of redemption, before the
        world was.
        2. He is by office, as Mediator, the Messenger of the
        covenant, and hath gotten commission to reveal it.
        3. He began actually to reveal it in paradise, where he
        promised, that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of
        the serpent.
        4. He set forth his own death and sufferings, and the great
        benefits that should come thereby to us, in the types and
        figures of sacrifices and ceremonies before his coming.
        5. He gave more and more light about this covenant, speaking
        by his Spirit, from age to age, in the holy prophets.
        6. He came himself, in the fulness of time, and did bear
        witness of all things belonging to this covenant, and of God's
        willing mind to take believers into it; partly, by uniting our
        nature in one person with the divine nature; partly, by
        preaching the good tidings of the covenant with his own mouth;
        partly, by paying the price of redemption on the cross; and
        partly, by dealing still with the people, from the beginning
        to this. day, to draw in, and to hold in the redeemed in this
        covenant.

        Thirdly, God hath made a gift of Christ, as a leader to the
        people, to bring us through all difficulties, all afflictions
        and temptations, unto life, by this covenant: and he it is,
        and no other, who doth indeed lead his own unto the covenant;
        and, in the covenant, all the way on unto salvation:
        1. By the direction of his word and Spirit,
        2. By the example of his own life, in faith and obedience,
        even to the death of the cross.
        3. By his powerful working, bearing his redeemed ones in his
        arms, and causing them to lean on him, while they go up
        through the wilderness.

        Fourthly, God hath made a gift of Christ unto his people, as a
        commander: which office he faithfully exerciseth, by giving to
        his kirk and people laws and ordinances, pastors and
        governors, and all necessary officers; by keeping courts and
        assemblies among them, to see that his laws be obeyed;
        subduing, by his word, Spirit, and discipline, his people's
        corruptions; and, by his wisdom and power, guarding them
        against all their enemies whatsoever.

        Hence he who hath closed bargain with God may strengthen his
        faith, by reasoning after this manner:

        "Whosoever doth heartily receive the offer of free grace, made
        here to sinners, thirsting for righteousness and salvation:
        unto him, by an everlasting covenant, belongeth Christ, the
        true David, with all his sure and saving mercies: 
        "But I (may the weak believer say) do heartily receive the
        offer of free grace made here to sinners, thirsting for
        righteousness and salvation:
        "Therefore unto me, by an everlasting covenant, belongeth
        Christ Jesus, with all his sure and saving mercies."

        The second Warrant and special Motive to embrace Christ, and
        believe in him, is the earnest request that God maketh to us
        to be reconciled to him in Christ; holden forth, 2 Corinthians
        5:19-21.

        Ver. 19. God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
        himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
        committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Ver. 20. Now
        then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
        you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
        God. Ver. 21. For he hath made, him to be sin for us, who knew
        no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

        Wherein the apostle teacheth us these nine doctrines:

        1. That the elect world, or world of redeemed souls, are by
        nature in the estate of enmity against God. This is
        presupposed in the word reconciliation; for reconciliation, or
        renewing of friendship, cannot be, except betwixt those that
        have been at enmity.
        2. That in all the time bypast, since the fall of Adam, Christ
        Jesus, the eternal Son of God, as Mediator, and the Father in
        him, hath been about the making friendship (by his word and
        Spirit) betwixt himself and the elect world: God (saith he)
        was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.
        3. That the way of reconciliation was in all ages one and the
        same in substance, viz., by forgiving the sins of them who do
        acknowledge their sins and their enmity against God, and do
        seek reconciliation and remission of sins in Christ: For God
        (saith he) was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
        by way of not imputing their trespasses unto them.
        4. That the end and scope of the gospel, and whole word of
        God, is threefold:
        	1. It serveth to make people sensible of
        their sins, and of their enmity against God, and of their
        danger, if they should stand out, and not fear God's
        displeasure.
        	2. The word of God serveth to make men
        acquainted with the course which God hath prepared for making
        friendship with them through Christ, viz., That if men shall
        acknowledge the enmity, and shall be content to enter into a
        covenant of friendship with God through Christ, then God will
        be content to be reconciled with them freely.
        	3. The word of
        God serveth to teach men how to carry themselves towards God,
        as friends, after they are reconciled to him, viz., to be
        loath to sin against him, and to strive heartily to obey his
        commandments: and therefore the word of God here is called the
        word of reconciliation, because it teacheth us what need we
        have of reconciliation, and how to make it, and how to keep
        the reconciliation of friendship, being made with God through
        Christ.
        5. That albeit the hearing, believing, and obeying of this
        word, doth belong to all those to whom this gospel doth come;
        yet the office of preaching of it with authority belongeth to
        none, but to such only as God doth call to his ministry, and
        sendeth out with commission for this work. This the apostle
        holdeth forth, Ver. 19, in these words, He hath committed unto
        us the word of reconciliation.
        6. That the ministers of the gospel should behave themselves
        as Christ's messengers, and should closely follow their
        commission set down in the word, Matt. xxviii. 19, 20; and
        when they do so, they should be received by the people as
        ambassadors from God; for here the apostle, in all their
        names, saith, We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
        beseech you by us.
        7. That ministers, in all earnestness of affections should
        deal with people, to acknowledge their sins, and their natural
        enmity against God, more and more seriously; and to consent to
        the covenant of grace and embassage of Christ more and more
        heartily; and to evidence more and more clearly their
        reconciliation, by a holy carriage before God. This he holdeth
        forth, when he saith, We pray you, be ye reconciled to God.
        8. That in the ministers' affectionate dealing with the
        people, the people should consider that they have to do with
        God and Christ, requesting them, by the ministers, to be
        reconciled. Now, there cannot be a greater inducement to break
        a sinner's hard heart, than God's making a request to him for
        friendship; for when it became us, who have done so many
        wrongs to God, to seek friendship of God, he preventeth us:
        and (O wonder of wonders!) he requesteth us to be content to
        be reconciled to him; and therefore most fearful wrath must
        abide them who do set light by this request, and do not yield
        when they hear ministers with commission, saying, We are
        ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us:
        we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
        9. To make it appear how it cometh to pass that the covenant
        of reconciliation should be so easily made up betwixt God and
        a humble sinner fleeing to Christ, the apostle leads us unto
        the cause of it, holden forth in the covenant of redemption,
        the sum whereof is this: "It is agreed betwixt God and the
        Mediator Jesus Christ the Son of God, surety for the redeemed,
        as parties contractors, that the sins of the redeemed should
        be imputed to innocent Christ, and he both condemned and put
        to death for them, upon this very condition, that whosoever
        heartily consents unto the covenant of reconciliation offered
        through Christ, shall, by the imputation of his obedience unto
        them, be justified and holden righteous before God; for God
        hath made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, (saith
        the apostle,) that we might be made the righteousness of God
        in him."

        Hence may a weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning
        from this ground after this manner:

        "He that, upon the loving request of God and Christ, made to
        him by the mouth of ministers, (having commission to that
        effect,) hath embraced the offer of perpetual reconciliation
        through Christ, and doth purpose, by God's grace, as a
        reconciled person, to strive against sin, and to serve God to
        his power constantly, may be as sure to have righteousness and
        eternal life given to him, for the obedience of Christ imputed
        to him, as it is sure that Christ was condemned and put to
        death for the sins of the redeemed imputed to him:
        "But I, (may the weak believer say,) upon the loving request
        of God and Christ, made to me by the mouth of his ministers,
        have embraced the offer of perpetual reconciliation through
        Christ, and do purpose, by God's grace, as a reconciled
        person, to strive against sin, and to serve God to my power
        constantly:
        "Therefore I may be as sure to have righteousness and eternal
        life given to me, for the obedience of Christ imputed to me,
        as it is sure that Christ was condemned and put to death for
        the sins of the redeemed imputed to him."

        The third Warrant and special Motive to believe in Christ, is
        the strait and awful command of God, charging all the hearers
        of the gospel to approach to Christ in the order set down by
        him, and to believe in him; holden forth, 1 John 3:23.

        This is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of
        his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another., as he gave us
        commandment.

        Wherein the apostle giveth us to understand these five
        doctrines:

        1. That if any man shall not be taken with the sweet
        invitation of God, nor with the humble and loving request of
        God, made to him to be reconciled, he shall find he hath to do
        with the sovereign authority of the highest Majesty; for this
        is his commandment, that we believe in him, saith he.
        2. That if any man look upon this, commandment as he hath
        looked heretofore upon the neglected commandments of the law,
        he must consider that this is a command of the gospel,
        posterior to the law, given for making use of the remedy of
        all sins; which, if it be disobeyed, there is no other command
        to follow but this, "Go, ye cursed, into the everlasting fire
        of hell;" for this is his commandment; the obedience of which
        is most pleasant in his sight, Ver. 22, and without which it
        is impossible to please him, Hebrews 11:6.
        3. That every one who heareth the gospel, must make conscience
        of the duty of lively faith in Christ; the weak believer must
        not think it presumption to do what is commanded; the person
        inclined to desperation must take up himself, and think upon
        obedience unto this sweet and saving command; the strong
        believer must dip yet more in the sense of his need he hath of
        Jesus Christ, and more and more grow in the obedience of this
        command; yea, the most impenitent, profane, and wicked person
        must not thrust, out himself, or be thrust out by others, from
        orderly aiming at this duty, how desperate soever his
        condition seems to be; for he that commands all men to believe
        in Christ, doth thereby command all men to believe that they
        are damned and lost without Christ; he thereby commands all
        men to acknowledge their sins, and their need of Christ, and
        in effect commands all men to repent, that they may believe in
        him. And whosoever do refuse to repent of their bygone sins,
        are guilty of disobedience to this command given to all
        hearers, but especially to those that are within the visible
        church: for this is his commandment, That we should believe on
        the name of his Son Jesus Christ, saith he.
        4. That he who obeyeth this commandment hath built his
        salvation on a solid ground: for,
        	1. He hath found the promised Messiah, completely furnished
        	with all perfections unto the perfect execution of the
        	offices of Prophet, Priest, and King; for he is that Christ
        	in whom the man doth believe.
        	2. He hath embraced a Saviour, who is able to save to the
        	uttermost, yea, and who doth effectually save every one that
        	cometh to God through him; for he is Jesus, the true Saviour
        	of his people from their sins.
        	3. He that obeyeth this command hath built his salvation on
        	the Rock, that is, on the Son of God, to whom it is no
        	robbery to be called equal to the Father, and who is worthy
        	to be the object of saving faith, and of spiritual worship:
        	for this is his command, (saith he,) That we believe in the
        	name of his Son Jesus Christ.
        6. That he who hath believed on Jesus Christ, though he be
        freed from the curse of the law, is not freed from the command
        and obedience of the law, but tied thereunto by a new
        obligation, and a new command from Christ; which new command
        from Christ importeth help to obey the command: unto which
        command from Christ, the Father addeth his authority and
        command also; for this is his commandment, (saith John,) That
        we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one
        another, as he hath commanded us. The first part of which
        command, enjoining belief in him, necessarily implieth love to
        God, and so obedience to the first table; for believing in
        God, and loving God, are inseparable; and the second part of
        the command enjoineth love to our neighbour, (especially to
        the household of faith,) and so obedience to the second table
        of the law. 

        Hence may a weak believer strengthen himself, by reasoning
        from this ground after this manner:

        "Whosoever, in the sense of his own sinfulness, and fear of
        God's wrath, at the command of God, is fled to Jesus Christ,
        the only remedy of sin and misery, and hath engaged his heart
        to the obedience of the law of love, his faith is not
        presumptuous or dead, but true and saving faith:
        "But I, (may the weak believer say,) in the sense of my own
        sinfulness, and fear of God's wrath, am fled to Jesus Christ,
        the only remedy of sin and misery, and have engaged my heart
        to the obedience of the law of love:
        "Therefore my faith is not a presumptuous and dead faith, but
        true and saving faith." 

        The fourth Warrant and special Motive to believe in Christ, is
        much assurance of life given, in case men shall obey the
        command of believing; and a fearful certification of
        destruction, in case they obey not; holden forth, John
        3:35-36.

        Ver. 35. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things
        into his hand. Ver. 36. He that believeth on the Son hath
        everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not
        see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

        Wherein are holden forth to us these five following doctrines:

        1. That the Father is well satisfied with the undertakings of
        the Son, entered Redeemer and Surety, to pay the ransom of
        believers and to perfect them in holiness and salvation: The
        Father loveth the Son, saith he; viz., as he standeth Mediator
        in our name, undertaking to perfect our redemption in all
        points: The Father loveth him, that is, doth heartily accept
        his offer to do the work, and is well pleased with him: his
        soul delighteth in him, and resteth upon him, and maketh him,
        in this his office, the "receptacle of love, and grace, and
        good will," to be conveyed by him to believers in him.
        2. That, for fulfilling of the covenant of redemption, the
        Father hath given to the Son (as he standeth in the capacity
        of the Mediator, or as he is God incarnate, the Word made
        flesh) all authority in heaven and earth, all furniture of the
        riches of grace, and of spirit and life, with all power, and
        ability, which the union of the divine nature with the human,
        or which the fulness of the Godhead dwelling substantially in
        his human nature, or which the indivisible all-sufficiency and
        omnipotency of the inseparable, everywhere present Trinity
        doth import, or the work of redemption can require: The Father
        (saith he) hath given all things into his hand, to wit, for
        accomplishing his work.
        3. Great assurance of life is holden forth to all who shall
        heartily receive Christ, and the offer of the covenant of
        grace and reconciliation through him: He that believeth on the
        Son (saith he) hath everlasting life; for it is made fast unto
        him,
        	1. In God's purpose and irrevocable decree, as the believer
        	is a man elected to life.
        	2. By effectual calling of him unto life by God, who, as he
        	is faithful, so will he do it.
        	3. By promise and everlasting covenant, sworn by God, to give
        	the believer strong consolation in life and death, upon
        	immutable grounds.
        	4. By a pawn and infeftment under the great seal of the
        	sacrament of the Lord's supper, so oft as the believer shall
        	come to receive the symbols and pledges of life.
        	5. In Christ the fountain and head of life, who is entered in
        	possession, as attorney for believers; in whom our life is so
        	laid up, that it cannot be taken away.
        	6. By begun possession of spiritual life and regeneration,
        	and a kingdom consisting in righteousness, peace, and joy in
        	the Holy Ghost, erected within the believer, as earnest of
        	the full possession of everlasting life.
        4. A fearful certification is given, if a man receive not the
        doctrine concerning righteousness and eternal life to be had
        by Jesus Christ: He that believeth not the Son shall not see
        life; that is, not so much as understand what it meaneth.
        5. He further certifieth, that if a man receive not the
        doctrine of the Son of God, he shall be burdened twice with
        the wrath of God; once, as a born rebel by nature, he shall
        bear the curse of the law, or the covenant of works; and next,
        he shall endure a greater condemnation, in respect that light
        being come into the world, and offered to him, he hath
        rejected it, and loveth darkness rather than light: and this
        double wrath shall be fastened and fixed immovably upon him,
        so long as he remaineth in the condition of misbelief: The
        wrath of God abideth on him, saith he.

        Hence may the weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning
        from this ground after this manner:

        "Whosoever believeth the doctrine delivered by the Son of God,
        and findeth himself partly drawn powerfully to believe in him,
        by the sigh of life in him, and partly driven, by the fear of
        God's wrath, to adhere unto him, may be sure of right and
        interest to life eternal through him:
        "But sinful and unworthy I (may the weak believer say) do
        believe the doctrine delivered by the Son of God, and do feel
        myself partly drawn powerfully to believe in him, by the sight
        of life in him, and partly driven, by the fear of God's wrath,
        to adhere unto him:
        "Therefore I may be sure of my right and interest unto eternal
        life through him."

  - name: THE EVIDENCES OF TRUE FAITH
    text: |

        So much for the laying the grounds of faith, and warrants to
        believe. Now, for evidencing of true faith by fruits, these
        four things are requisite:

        I. That the believer be soundly convinced, in his judgment, of
        his obligation to keep the whole moral law, all the days of
        his life; and that not the less, but so much the more, as he
        is delivered by Christ from the covenant of works, and curse
        of the law.

        II. That he endeavour to grow in the exercise and daily
        practice of godliness and righteousness.

        III. That the course of his new obedience run in the right
        channel, that is, through faith in Christ, and through a good
        conscience, to all the duties of love towards God and man. 

        IV. That he keep strait communion with the fountain Christ
        Jesus, from whom grace must run along, for furnishing of good
        fruits. 

        For the first, viz., To convince the believer, in his
        judgment, of his obligation to keep the moral law, among many
        passages, take Matthew 5:16-20.

        Ver. 16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
        your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
        Ver. 17. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
        prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. Ver. 18.
        For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
        or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
        fulfilled. Ver. 19. Whosoever therefore shall break one of
        these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be
        called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall
        do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the
        kingdom of heaven. Ver. 20. For I say unto you, That except
        your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
        Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
        heaven.

        Wherein our Lord,

        1. Giveth commandment to believers, justified by faith, to
        give evidence of the grace of God in them before men, by doing
        good works: Let your light so shine before men, (saith he,)
        that they may see your good works.
        2. He induceth them so to do, by showing, that albeit they be
        not justified by works, yet spectators of their good works may
        be converted or edified; and so glory may redound to God by
        their good works, when the witnesses thereof shall glorify
        your Father which is in heaven.
        3. He gives them no other rule for their new obedience than
        the moral law, set down and explicated by Moses and the
        prophets: Think not (saith he) that I am come to destroy the
        law, or the prophets.
        4. He gives them to understand, that the doctrine of grace,
        and freedom from the curse of the law by faith in him, is
        readily mistaken by men's corrupt judgments, as if it did
        loose or slacken the obligation of believers to obey the
        commands, and to be subject to the authority of the law; and
        that this error is indeed a destroying of the law and of the
        prophets, which he will in no case ever endure in any of his
        disciples, it is so contrary to the end of his coming, which
        is first to sanctify, and then to save believers: Think not
        (saith he) that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets.
        5. He teacheth, that the end of the gospel and covenant of
        grace is to procure men's obedience unto the moral law: "I am
        come (saith he) to fulfil the law and the prophets." 
        6. That the obligation of the moral law, in all points, unto
        all holy duties, is perpetual, and shall stand to the world's
        end, that is, till heaven and earth pass away.
        7. That as God hath had a care of the Scriptures from the
        beginning, so shall he have a care of them still to the
        world's end, that there shall not one jot or one tittle of the
        substance thereof be taken away; so saith the text, Ver. 18.
        8. That as the breaking of the moral law, and defending the
        transgressions thereof to be no sin, doth exclude men both
        from heaven, and justly also from the fellowship of the true
        kirk; so the obedience of the law, and teaching others to do
        the same, by example, counsel, and doctrine, according to
        every man's calling, proveth a man to be a true believer, and
        in great estimation with God, and worthy to be much esteemed
        of by the true church, Ver. 19.
        9. That the righteousness of every true Christian must be more
        than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees; for the
        scribes and Pharisees, albeit they took great pains to
        discharge sundry duties of the law, yet they cutted short the
        exposition thereof, that it might the less condemn their
        practice; they studied the outward part of the duty, but
        neglected the inward and spiritual part; they discharged some
        meaner duties carefully, but neglected judgment, mercy, and
        the love of God: in a word, they went about to establish their
        own righteousness, and rejected the righteousness of God by
        faith in Jesus:.But a true Christian must have more than all
        this; he must acknowledge the full extent of the spiritual
        meaning of the law, and have a respect to all the
        commandments, and labour to cleanse himself from all
        filthiness of flesh and spirit, and "not lay weight upon what
        service he hath done, or shall do," but clothe himself with
        the imputed righteousness of Christ, which only can hide his
        nakedness, or else he cannot be saved; so saith the text,
        Except your righteousness, etc.

        The second thing requisite to evidence true faith is, that the
        believer endeavour to put the rules of godliness and
        righteousness in practice, and to grow in the daily exercise
        thereof; holden forth, 2 Peter 1:5-8.

        Ver. 5. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your
        faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; Ver. 6. And to
        knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to
        patience, godliness; Ver. 7. And to godliness, brotherly-
        kindness; and to brotherly-kindness, charity. Ver. 8. For if
        these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
        shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in, the knowledge of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.

        Wherein,

        1. The apostle teacheth believers, for evidencing of precious
        faith in themselves, to endeavour to add to their faith seven
        other sister graces. The first is Virtue, or the active
        exercise and practice of all moral duties, that so faith may
        not be idle, but put forth itself in work. The second is
        Knowledge, which serves to furnish faith with information of
        the truth to be believed, and to furnish virtue with direction
        what duties are to be done, and how to go about them
        prudently. The third is Temperance, which serveth to moderate
        the use of all pleasant things, that a man be not clogged
        therewith, nor made unfit for any duty whereto he is called.
        The fourth is Patience, which serveth to moderate a man's
        affections, when he meeteth with any difficulty or unpleasant
        thing, that he neither weary for pains required in well-doing,
        nor faint when the Lord chastiseth him, nor murmur when he
        crosseth him. The fifth is Godliness, which may keep him up in
        all the exercises of religion, inward and outward; whereby he
        may be furnished from God for all other duties which he hath
        to do. The sixth is Brotherly-kindness, which keepeth
        estimation of, and affection to, all the household of faith,
        and to the image of God in every one wheresoever it is seen.
        The seventh is Love, which keepeth the heart in readiness to
        do good to all men, whatsoever they be, upon all occasions
        which God shall offer.
        2. Albeit it be true, that there is much corruption and
        infirmity in the godly; yet the apostle will have men
        uprightly endeavouring, and doing their best, as they are
        able, to join all these graces one to another, and to grow in
        the measure of exercising them: Giving all diligence, (saith
        he,) add to your faith, etc.
        3. He assureth all professed believers, that as they shall
        profit in the obedience of this direction, so they shall
        profitably prove the soundness of their own faith: and, if
        they want these graces, that they shall be found blind
        deceivers of themselves, Ver. 9.

        The third thing requisite to evidence true faith is, that
        obedience to the law run in the right channel, that is,
        through faith in Christ, etc.; holden forth, 1 Timothy 1:5.

        Now the end of the commandment is love, out of a pure heart,
        and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.

        Wherein the apostle teacheth these seven doctrines:

        1. That the obedience of the law must flow from love, and love
        from a pure heart, and a pure heart from a good conscience,
        and a good conscience from faith unfeigned: this he makes the
        only right channel of good works: The end of the law is love,
        etc.
        2. That the end of the law is not, that men may be justified
        by their obedience of it, as the Jewish doctors did falsely
        teach; for it is impossible that sinners can be justified by
        the law, who, for every transgression, are condemned by the
        law: For the end of the law is (not such as the Jewish doctors
        taught, but) love, out of a pure heart, etc.
        3. That the true end of the law, preached unto the people, is,
        that they, by the law, being made to see their deserved
        condemnation, should flee to Christ unfeignedly, to be
        justified by faith in him; so saith the text, while it maketh
        love to flow through faith in Christ.
        4. That no man can set himself in love to obey the law,
        excepting as far as his conscience is quieted by faith, or is
        seeking to be quieted in Christ; for the end of the law is
        love, out of a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.
        5. That feigned faith goeth to Christ without reckoning with
        the law, and so wants an errand; but unfeigned faith reckoneth
        with the law, and is forced to flee for refuge unto Christ, as
        the end of the law for righteousness, so often as it finds
        itself guilty for breaking of the law: For the end of the law
        is . . . faith unfeigned.
        6. That the fruits of love may come forth in act particularly,
        it is necessary that the heart be brought to the hatred of all
        sin and uncleanness, and to a steadfast purpose to follow all
        holiness universally: For the end of the law is love, out of a
        pure heart.
        7. That unfeigned faith is able to make the conscience good,
        and the heart pure, and the man lovingly obedient to the law;
        for when Christ's blood is seen by faith to quiet justice,
        then the conscience becometh quiet also, and will not suffer
        the heart to entertain the love of sin, but sets the man on
        work to fear God for his mercy, and to obey all his
        commandments, out of love to God, for his free gift of
        justification, by grace bestowed on him: For this is the end
        of the law indeed, whereby it obtaineth of a man more
        obedience than any other way.

        The fourth thing requisite to evidence true faith is, the
        keeping strait communion with Christ, the fountain of all
        graces, and of all good works; holden forth, John 15:5.

        I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and
        I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me
        ye can do nothing.

        Wherein Christ, in a similitude from a vine-tree, teacheth us,

        1. That by nature we are wild barren briers, till we be
        changed by coming unto Christ; and that Christ is that noble
        vine-tree, having all life and sap of grace in himself, and
        able to change the nature of every one that cometh to him, and
        to communicate spirit and life to as many as shall believe in
        him: I am the vine, (saith he,) and ye are the branches.
        2. That Christ loveth to have believers so united unto him, as
        that they be not separated at any time by unbelief: and that
        there may be a mutual inhabitation of them in him, by faith
        and love; and of him in them, by his word and Spirit; for he
        joineth these together, If ye abide in me, and I in you, as
        things inseparable.
        3. That except a man be ingrafted into Christ, and united to
        him by faith, he cannot do any the least good works of his own
        strength; yea, except in as far as a man doth draw spirit and
        life from Christ by faith, the work which he doth is naughty
        and null in point of goodness in God's estimation: For without
        me (saith he) ye can do nothing.
        4. That this mutual inhabitation is the fountain and
        infallible cause of constant continuing and abounding in well-
        doing: For he that abideth in me, and I in him, (saith he,)
        the same beareth much fruit. Now, as our abiding in Christ
        presupposeth three things:
        	1. That we have heard the joyful sound of the gospel, making
        	offer of Christ to us, who are lost sinners by the law;
        	2. That we have heartily embraced the gracious offer of
        	Christ;
        	3. That by receiving of him we are become the sons of God,
        	John 1:12, and are incorporated into his mystical body, that
        	he may dwell in us, as his temple, and we dwell in him, as in
        	the residence of righteousness and life: so our abiding in
        	Christ importeth other three things:
        		1. An employing of Christ in all our addresses to God, and
        		in all out undertakings of whatsoever piece of service to
        		him;
        		2. A contentedness with his sufficiency, without going out
        		from him to seek righteousness, or life, or furniture in any
        		case, in our own or any of the creature's worthiness;
        		3. A fixedness in our believing in him, a fixedness in our
        		employing and making use of him, and a fixedness in our
        		contentment in him, and adhering to him, so that no
        		allurement, no temptation of Satan or the world, no terror
        		nor trouble, may be able to drive our spirits from firm
        		adherence to him, or from the constant avowing of his truth,
        		and obeying his commands, who hath loved us, and given
        		himself for us; and in whom not only our life is laid up,
        		but also the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily, by
        		reason of the substantial and personal union of the divine
        		and human nature in him.

        Hence let every watchful believer, for strengthening himself
        in faith and obedience, reason after this manner:

        "Whosoever doth daily employ Christ Jesus for cleansing his
        conscience and affections from the guiltiness and filthiness
        of sins against the law, and for enabling him to give
        obedience to the law in love, he hath the evidence of true
        faith in himself:
        "But I (may every watchful believer say) do daily employ Jesus
        Christ for cleansing my conscience and affections from the
        guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the law, and for
        enabling of me to give obedience to the law in love:
        "Therefore I have the evidence of true faith in myself."

        And hence also let the sleepy and sluggish believer reason,
        for his own upstirring, thus:

        "Whatsoever is necessary for giving evidence of true faith, I
        study to do it, except I would deceive myself and perish:
        "But to employ Christ Jesus daily for cleansing of my
        conscience and affections from the guiltiness and filthiness
        of sins against the law, and for enabling me to give obedience
        to the law in love, is necessary for evidencing of true faith
        in me: 
        "Therefore this I must study to do, except I would deceive
        myself and perish."

        And, lastly,

        Seeing Christ himself hath pointed this forth, as an undoubted
        evidence of a man elected of God unto life, and given to Jesus
        Christ to be redeemed, "if he come unto him," that is, close
        covenant, and keep communion with him, as he teacheth us, John
        6:37, saying, All that the Father hath given me shall come to
        me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out; let
        every person, who doth not in earnest make use of Christ for
        remission of sin, and amendment of life, reason hence, and
        from the whole premises, after this manner, that his
        conscience may be awakened:

        "Whosoever is neither by the law, nor by the gospel, so
        convinced of sin, righteousness, and judgment, as to make him
        come to Christ, and employ him daily for remission of sin, and
        amendment of life; he wanteth not only all evidence of saving
        faith, but also all appearance of his election, so long as he
        remaineth in this condition:
        "But I (may every impenitent person say) am neither by the law
        nor gospel so convinced of sin, righteousness, and judgment,
        as to make me come to Christ, and employ him daily for
        remission of sin, and amendment of life:
        "Therefore I want not only all evidence of saving faith, but
        also all appearance of my election, so long as I remain in
        this condition."
