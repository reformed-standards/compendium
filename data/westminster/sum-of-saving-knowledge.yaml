      1. The woeful condition which all men are in by nature, through breaking of the covenant of works.
      2. The remedy provided for the elect in Jesus Christ by the covenant of grace.
      3. The means appointed to make them partakers of this covenant.
      4. The blessings which are effectually conveyed to the elect by these means.

      Consider these four points

      ### Head I.

      Our woeful condition by nature, through breaking the covenant of works.

      Hos 13.9 "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself."

      I. In eternity past, God did most wisely decree, for his own glory,
      whatever comes to pass in time: and in a most holy and infallible manner
      executes all his decrees, without being author of the sin of any creature.

      II. God originally made everything from nothing, perfect. He made our
      first parents, Adam and Eve, the root of mankind, both upright and able to
      keep the law written in their hearts. This law they were naturally bound
      to obey upon penalty of death. God was not bound to reward their service,
      till he entered into a covenant or contract with them, and their posterity
      in them. He promised to give them eternal life, upon condition of perfect
      personal obedience. If they failed they would die. This is the covenant of
      works.

      III. Both angels and men were subject to the change of their own free
      will. God alone is unchangeable. Many angels of their own accord fell by
      sin from their first estate, and became demons. Our first parents, being
      enticed by Satan, one of these demons, broke the covenant of works, by
      eating the forbidden fruit. By this action, they, and their posterity,
      became not only liable to eternal death, but also lost all ability to
      please God. They became by nature enemies to God, and to all spiritual
      good, and were only inclined to do evil continually. This is our original
      sin, the bitter root of all our actual transgressions, in thought, word,
      and deed.

      ### Head II.

      The remedy provided in Jesus Christ for the elect by the covenant of
      Grace.

      "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help." Hos 13.9

      I. Albeit man, having brought himself into this woeful condition, is
      neither able to help himself, nor willing to be helped by God out of it,
      but rather inclined to lie still, insensible of it, till he perish; yet
      God, for the glory of his rich grace, has revealed in his word a way to
      save sinners, that is, by faith in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God,
      by virtue of, and according to the tenor of the covenant of redemption,
      made and agreed upon between God the Father and God the Son, in council of
      the Trinity, before the world began.

      II. The sum of the covenant of redemption is this: God having freely
      chosen to life a certain number of lost mankind, for the glory of his rich
      grace, did give them, before the world began, to God the Son, appointed
      Redeemer, that, upon condition he would humble himself so far as to assume
      the human nature, of a soul and a body, to personal union with his divine
      nature, and submit himself to the law, as surety for them, and satisfy
      justice for them, by giving obedience in their name, even to the suffering
      of the cursed death of the cross, he should ransom and redeem them all
      from sin and death, and purchase to them righteousness and eternal life,
      with all saving graces leading there to, to be effectually, by means of
      his own appointment, applied in due time to every one of them. This
      condition the Son of God (who is Jesus Christ our Lord) did accept before
      the world began, and in the fulness of time came into the world, was born
      of the Virgin Mary, subjected himself to the law, and completely paid the
      ransom on the cross: But by virtue of the foresaid bargain, made before
      the world began, he is in all ages, since the fall of Adam, still upon the
      work of applying actually the purchased benefits of the elect; and that he
      does by way of entertaining a covenant of free grace and reconciliation
      with them, through faith in himself; by which covenant, he makes over to
      every believer a right and interest to himself, and to all his blessings.

      III. For the accomplishment of this covenant of redemption, and making the
      elect partakers of the benefits of it in the covenant of grace, Christ
      Jesus was clad with the threefold office of Prophet, Priest, and King:
      made a Prophet, to reveal all saving knowledge to his people, and persuade
      them to believe and obey the same; made a Priest, to offer up himself a
      sacrifice once for them all, and to intercede continually with the Father,
      for making their persons and services acceptable to him; and made a King,
      to subdue them to himself, to feed and rule them by his own appointed
      ordinances, and to defend them from their enemies.

      ### Head III.

      The outward means appointed to make the elect partakers of this covenant,
      and all the rest that are called, to be inexcusable.

      "Many are called." Matt. 22.14

      I. The outward means and ordinances, for making men partakers of the
      covenant of grace, are so wisely dispensed, as that the elect shall be
      infallibly converted and saved by them; and the reprobate, among whom they
      are, not to be justly damned: The means are especially these four:

      i. The word of God
      ii. The ordinances
      iii. Church
      iv. Prayer

      In the word of God preached by sent messengers, the Lord makes offer of
      grace to all sinners, upon condition of faith in Jesus Christ; and whoever
      does confess their sin, accept Christ's offering, and submit themselves to
      his ordinances, he will have them received into the honour and privileges
      of the covenant of grace. By the ordinances, God will have the covenant
      sealed for confirming the bargain on the foresaid condition. By the
      Church, he will have them hedged in, and helped forward to the keeping of
      the covenant. And by prayer, he will have his own glorious grace, promised
      in the covenant, to be daily drawn forth, acknowledged, and employed. All
      these means are followed either really, or in profession only, according
      to the quality of the covenanters, as they are true or counterfeit
      believers.

      II. The covenant of grace, set down in the Old Testament before Christ
      came, and in the New since he came, is one and the same in substance,
      albeit different in outward administration: For the covenant in the Old
      Testament, being sealed with the ordinances of circumcision and the
      paschal lamb, did set forth Christ's death to come, and the benefits
      purchased by it, under the shadow of bloody sacrifices, and various
      ceremonies: but since Christ came, the covenant being sealed by the
      ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper, does clearly hold forth
      Christ already crucified before our eyes, victorious over death and the
      grave, and gloriously ruling heaven and earth, for the good of his own
      people.

      ### Head IV.

      The blessings which are effectually conveyed by these means to the Lord's elect, or chosen ones.

      "Many are called, but few are chosen." Matt 12.14.

      I. By those outward ordinances, as our Lord makes the reprobate
      inexcusable, so, by the power of his Spirit, he applies to the elect,
      effectually, all saving graces purchased to them in the covenant of
      redemption, and makes a change in their persons. In particular,

      II. He does convert or regenerate them, by giving spiritual life to them,
      in opening their understandings, renewing their wills, affections, and
      faculties, for giving spiritual obedience to his commands.

      III. He gives them saving faith, by making them, in the sense of deserved
      condemnation, to give their consent heartily to the covenant of grace, and
      to embrace Jesus Christ unfeignedly.

      IV. He gives them repentance, by making them, with godly sorrow, in the
      hatred of sin, and love of righteousness, turn from all iniquity to the
      service of God.

      V. He sanctifies them, by making them go on and persevere in faith and
      spiritual obedience to the law of God, manifested by fruitfulness in all
      duties, and doing good works, as God offers occasion.

      VI. Together with this inward change of their persons, God changes also
      their state: for, so soon as they are brought by faith into the covenant
      of grace,

      VII. He justifies them, by imputing to them that perfect obedience which
      Christ gave to the law, and the satisfaction also which upon the cross
      Christ gave to justice in their name.

      VIII. He reconciles them, and makes them friends to God, who were before
      enemies of God.

      IX. He adopts them, that they shall be no more children of Satan, but
      children of God, enriched with all spiritual privileges of his sons.

      X. And, last of all, after their warfare in this life is ended, he
      perfects the holiness and blessedness, first of their souls at their
      death, and then both of their souls and their bodies, being joyfully
      joined together again in the resurrection, at the day of his glorious
      coming to judgment, when all the wicked shall be sent away to hell, with
      Satan whom they have served: but Christ's own chosen and redeemed ones,
      true believers, students of holiness, shall remain with himself for ever,
      in the state of glorification.

  - name: The Practical Use of Saving Knowledge
    text: |


      Contained in Scripture, and held forth briefly in the foresaid Confession
      of Faith and Catechisms.

      The chief general use of Christian doctrine is, to convince a man of sin,
      and of righteousness, and of judgment, John 16:8 partly by the law or
      covenant of works, that he may be humbled and become penitent; and partly
      by the gospel or covenant of grace, that he may become an unfeigned
      believer in Jesus Christ, and be strengthened in his faith upon solid
      grounds and warrants, and give evidence of the truth of his faith by good
      fruits, and so be saved.

      The sum of the covenant of works, or of the law, is this:

      "If thou do all that is commanded, and not fail in any point, thou shalt
      be saved: but if thou fail, thou shalt die." Ro. 10:5, Gal 3:10,12.

      The sum of the gospel, or covenant of grace and reconciliation, is this:

      "If thou flee from deserved wrath to the true Redeemer Jesus Christ, (who
      is able to save to the uttermost all that come to God through him,) thou
      shalt not perish, but have eternal life." Rom 10:8,9,11.

      For convincing a man of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment by the law,
      or covenant of works, let those scriptures, among many more, be made use
      of.

      I. For convincing a man of sin by the law, consider Jer. 17.9,10

      "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can
      know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every
      man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings."

      Here the Lord teaches two things:

      i. That the fountain of all our wickedness, and actual sinning against
      God, is in the heart, which comprehends the mind, will, affections, and
      all the powers of the soul, as they are corrupted and defiled with
      original sin; the mind being not only ignorant and incapable of saving
      truth, but also full of error and enmity against God; and the will and
      affections being obstinately disobedient to all God's directions, and bend
      toward that only which is evil: "The heart" (saith he) "is deceitful above
      all things, and desperately wicked;" yea and unsearchably wicked, so that
      no man can know it; and Gen 6.5 "Every imagination of the thoughts "of
      man's heart is only evil continually," saith the Lord, whose testimony we
      must trust in this and all other matters; and experience also may teach
      us, that, till God make us deny ourselves, we never look to God in
      anything, but fleshly self interest alone does rule us, and move all the
      wheels of our actions.

      ii. That the Lord brings our original sin, or wicked inclination, with all
      its actual fruits, to reckoning before his judgment seat; "For he searches
      the heart, and tries the reins, to give every man according to his ways,
      and according to the fruit of his doings."

      Hence let every man reason thus:

      "What God and my guilty conscience bears witness of, I am convinced that
      it is true: But God and my guilty conscience bears witness that my heart
      is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; and that all the
      imaginations of my heart, are only evil continually:" "Therefore I am
      convinced that this true."

      Thus a man may be convinced of sin by the law.

      II. For convincing a man of righteousness by the law, consider Gal 3.10

      "As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is
      written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are
      written in the book of the law to do them."

      Here the apostle teaches us three things.

      i. That, by reason of our natural sinfulness, the impossibility of any
      man's being justified by the works of the law is so certain, that whoever
      does seek justification by works of the law, are liable to the curse of
      God for breaking of the law; "For as many as are of the works of the law
      are under the curse," he says.

      ii. That, to the perfect fulfilling of the law, the keeping of one or two
      of the precepts, or doing of some, or of all duties (if it were possible)
      for a time is not sufficient; for the law requires, that "a man continue
      in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."

      iii. That, because no man can come up to this perfection, every man by
      nature is under the curse; for the law says, "Cursed is every one that
      continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
      them."

      Now, to be under the curse, comprehends all the displeasure of God, with
      the danger of the breaking forth more and more of his wrath upon soul and
      body, both in this life, and after death perpetually, if grace does not
      prevent its execution.

      Hence let every man reason thus:

      "Whoever, according to the covenant of works, is liable to the curse of
      God for breaking the law, times and ways out of number, cannot be
      justified, or find righteousness by the works of the law:" But I, (may
      every man say,) according to the covenant of works, am liable to the curse
      of God, for breaking the law times and ways without number: Therefore I
      cannot be justified, or have righteousness by the works of the law."

      Thus may a man be convinced of righteousness, that it is not to be had by
      his own works, or by the law.

      III. For convincing a man of judgment by the law, consider:

      "The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In
      flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey
      not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with
      everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory
      of his power; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be
      admired in all them that believe." 2 Th. 2:7-10

      Wherein we are taught, that our Lord Jesus, who now offers to be Mediator
      for them who believe in him, shall, at the last day, come armed with
      flaming fire, to judge, condemn, and destroy all them who have not
      believed God, have not received the offer of grace made in the gospel, not
      obeyed its doctrine; but remain in their natural state, under the law or
      covenant of works.

      Hence let every man reason thus:

      "What the righteous Judge has forewarned me shall be done at the last day,
      I am sure is a just judgment: "But the righteous Judge has forewarned me,
      that if I do not believe God in time, and obey not the doctrine of the
      gospel, I shall be secluded from his presence and his glory at the last
      day, and be tormented in soul and body for ever:" "Therefore I am
      convinced that this is a just judgment:" "And I have reason to thank God
      heartily, who has forewarned me to flee from the wrath which is to come."

      Thus every man may be, by the law or covenant of works, convinced of
      judgment, if he shall continue under the covenant of works, or shall not
      obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

      IV. For convincing a man of sin, righteousness, and judgment, by the
      gospel.

      As for convincing a man of sin, and righteousness, and judgment, by the
      gospel, or covenant of grace, he must understand three things:

      i. That not believing in Jesus Christ, or refusing of the covenant of
      grace offered in him, is a greater and more dangerous sin than all other
      sins against the law; because the hearers of the gospel, not believing in
      Christ, do reject God's mercy in Christ, the only way of freedom from sin
      and wrath, and will not yield to be reconciled to God.

      ii. Next, he must understand, that perfect remission of sin, and true
      righteousness, is to be had only by faith in Jesus; but God requires no
      other conditions but faith; and testifies from heaven, that he is well
      pleased to justify sinners upon this condition.

      iii. He must understand, that upon righteousness received by faith,
      judgment shall follow, on the one hand, to the destroying of the works of
      the devil in the believer, and to the perfecting of the work of
      sanctification in him, with power: and that, upon refusing to take
      righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ, judgment shall follow, on the
      other hand, to the condemnation of the unbeliever, and destroying of him
      with Satan and his servants for ever.

      For this end, let these passages of scripture, among many others, serve to
      make the greatness of the sin of not believing in Christ appear; or, to
      make the greatness of the sin of refusing of the covenant of grace offered
      to us, in the offering of Christ to us appear, let the fair offer of grace
      be looked upon as it is made, Isa. 55:3 "Incline your ear, and come to me,
      (says the Lord:) hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an
      everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David." That is,
      If you will believe me, and be reconciled to me, I will, by covenant, give
      to you Christ, and all saving graces in him: repeated Acts 13:34.

      Again, consider, that this general offer in substance is equivalent to a
      special offer made to every one in particular; as appears by the apostle's
      making use of it, Acts 16:31. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
      shalt be saved, and thy house." The reason of which offer is given, John
      3:16. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
      that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
      life." Seeing then this great salvation is offered in the Lord Jesus,
      whoever believes not in him, but looks for happiness some other way, what
      does he else but observe lying vanities, and forsake his own mercy, which
      he might have had in Christ? Jonah 2:8,9. What does he else but blaspheme
      God in his heart? as it is said, 1 John 5:10,11. "He that believeth not
      God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God
      gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal
      life; and this life is in his Son." And that no sin against the law is
      like to this sin, Christ testifies, John 15:22. "If I had not come and
      spoken to them, they had not sin; but now they have no cloak for their
      sin." This may convince a man of the greatness of this sin of not
      believing in Christ.

      V. For convincing a man of righteousness to be had only by faith in Jesus
      Christ, consider how, Rom. 10:3,4

      It is said, that the Jews, "being ignorant of God's righteousness, and
      going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
      themselves unto the righteousness of God," (and so they perished.) "For
      Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
      believeth." And Acts 13:39. "By him all that believe are justified from
      all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses." And
      1 John 1:7 "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."

      For convincing a man of judgment, if a man embrace this righteousness,
      consider 1 John 3:8. "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that
      he might destroy the works of the devil." And Heb 9:14. "How much more
      shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself
      without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the
      living God."

      But if a man embrace not this righteousness, his doom is pronounced, John
      3:18,19. "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
      believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the
      condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness
      rather than light."

      Hence let the penitent, desiring to believe, reason thus:

      "What does suffice to convince all the elect in the world of the greatness
      of the sin of not believing in Christ, or refusing to flee to him for
      relief from sins done against the law, and from wrath due to it; and what
      suffices to convince them that righteousness and eternal life is to be had
      by faith in Jesus Christ, or by consenting to the covenant of grace in
      him; and what suffices to convince them of judgment to be exercised by
      Christ, for destroying the works of the devil in a man, and sanctifying
      and saving all that believe in him, may suffice to convince me also:" "But
      what the Spirit has said, in these or other like scriptures, suffices to
      convince the elect world of the foresaid sin, and righteousness, and
      judgment:" "Therefore what the Spirit has said, in these and other like
      scriptures, serves to convince me of it also."

      Whereupon let the penitent desiring to believe take with him words, and
      say heartily to the Lord, Seeing you say, "Seek ye my face;" my soul
      answers to you, "Thy face, Lord, will I seek." I have harkened to the
      offer of an everlasting covenant of all saving mercies to be had in
      Christ, and I do heartily embrace your offer. Lord, let it be a bargain;
      "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief:" Behold, I give myself to you, to
      serve you in all things for ever; and I hope "your right hand shall save
      me:" the Lord will perfect that which concerns me: your mercy, O Lord,
      endures for ever; forsake not "the works of thine own hands."

      Thus may a man be made an unfeigned believer in Christ.

      VI. For strengthening the man's faith who has agreed to the covenant of
      grace.

      Because many true believers are weak, and do much doubt if ever they shall
      be sure of the soundness of their own faith and effectual calling, or made
      certain of their justification and salvation, when they see that many who
      profess faith, are found to deceive themselves; let us see how every
      believer may be made strong in the faith, and sure of his own election and
      salvation upon solid grounds, by sure warrants, and true evidences of
      faith. To this end, among other scriptures, take these following.

      i. For laying solid grounds of Faith, consider Peter 1:10 "Therefore the
      rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure:
      for if ye do these things ye shall never fall."

      In which words, the apostle teaches us these four things, for help and
      direction how to be made strong in the faith.

      a. That such as believe in Christ Jesus, and are fled to him for relief
      from sin and wrath, albeit they be weak in the faith, yet they are indeed
      children of the same Father with the apostles; for so he accounts of them,
      while he calls them brethren.

      b. That albeit we are not sure, for the time, of our effectual calling and
      election, yet we may be made sure of both, if we use diligence; for this
      he presupposes, saying, "Give diligence; to make your calling and election
      sure."

      c. That we must not be discouraged, when we see many seeming believers
      prove rotten branches, and make defection; but we must the rather take the
      better heed to ourselves: "Wherefore the rather, brethren, (said he,) give
      all diligence."

      d. That the way to be sure both of our effectual calling and election, is
      to make sure work of our faith, by laying the grounds of it solidly, and
      bringing forth the fruits of our faith in new obedience constantly: "For
      if ye do these things, (said he,) ye shall never fall;" understanding by
      "these things" what he had said of sound faith, Verses 1,2,3,4 and what he
      had said of the bringing out of the fruits of faith, Verses 5.6,7,8,9.

      ii. To this same purpose, consider Rom 8.1,

      "1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
      Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 2 For the law
      of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin
      and death. 3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
      the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
      for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; 4 That the righteousness of the law
      might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after flesh, but after the Spirit."

      Wherein the apostle teaches us these four things, for laying of the ground
      of faith solidly:

      a. That every one is a true believer, who, in the sense of his sin, and
      fear of God's wrath, does flee for full relief from both to Jesus Christ
      alone, as the only Mediator and all-sufficient Redeemer of men; and, being
      fled to Christ, does strive against his own flesh, or corrupt inclination
      of nature, and studies to follow the rule of God's Spirit, set down in his
      word: for the man, whom the apostle does here bless as a true believer, is
      a man in Christ Jesus, "who doth not walk after the flesh, but after the
      Spirit."

      b. That all such persons as are fled to Christ, and do strive against sin,
      however they may be possibly exercised under the sense of wrath, and fear
      of condemnation, yet they are in no danger; for "there is no condemnation
      (said he) to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
      but after the Spirit."

      c. That albeit the apostle himself, (brought in here for example's cause,)
      and all other true believers in Christ, be by nature under the law of sin
      and death, or under the covenant of works, (called the law of sin and
      death, because it binds sin and death upon us, till Christ set us free;)
      yet the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, or the covenant of
      grace, (so called, because it does enable and quicken a man to a spiritual
      life through Christ,) does set the apostle, and all true believers, free
      from the covenant of works, or the law of sin and death: so that every man
      may say with him, "The law of the Spirit of life," or the covenant of
      grace, "has made me free from the law of sin and death," or the covenant
      of works.

      d. That the fountain and first ground, from whence our freedom from the
      curse of the law does flow, is the covenant of redemption, passed between
      God and God the Son as incarnate, wherein Christ takes the curse of the
      law upon him for sin, that the believer, who could not otherwise be
      delivered from the covenant of works, may be delivered from it. And this
      doctrine the apostle holdeth forth in these four branches:

      1. That it was utterly impossible for the law, or the covenant of works, to
      bring righteousness and life to a sinner, because it was weak.

      2. That this weakness and inability of the law, or covenant of works, is
      not the fault of the law, but the fault of sinful flesh, which is neither
      able to pay the penalty of sin, not to give perfect obedience to the law,
      (presupposing past sins were forgiven:) "The law was weak (said he,)
      through the flesh"

      3. That the righteousness and salvation of sinners, which was impossible to
      be brought about by the law, is brought to pass by sending God's own Son,
      Jesus Christ, in the flesh, in whose flesh sin is condemned and punished,
      for making satisfaction in the behalf of the elect, that they might be set
      free.

      4. That by his means the law loses nothing, because the righteousness of
      the law is best fulfilled this way, first, by Christ's giving perfect
      active obedience in our name to it in all things; next, by his paying in
      our name the penalty due to our sins in his death: and, lastly, by his
      working of sanctification in us, who are true believers, who strive to
      give new obedience to the law, and "walk not after the flesh, but after
      the Spirit."


  - name: Warrants to Believe
    text: |

      ### Section 1

      For building our confidence upon this solid ground, these four Warrants
      and special Motives to believe in Christ may serve.

      The first is God's hearty invitation, held forth, Isa. 55:1-4.

      "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no
      money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money
      and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for [that which is] not
      bread? and your labour for [that which] satisfieth not? hearken diligently
      unto me, and eat ye [that which is] good, and let your soul delight itself
      in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
      live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, [even] the sure
      mercies of David. Behold, I have given him [for] a witness to the people,
      a leader and commander to the people."

      Here (after setting down the precious ransom of our redemption by the
      sufferings of Christ, and the rich blessings purchased to us by it, in the
      two former chapters) the Lord, in this chapter,

      I. Makes open offer of Christ and his grace, by proclamation of a free and
      gracious market of righteousness and salvation, to be had through Christ
      to every soul, without exception, that truly desires to be saved from sin
      and wrath: "Ho, every one that thirsteth".

      II. He invites all sinners, that for any reason stand at a distance from
      God, to come and take from him riches of grace, running in Christ as a
      river, to wash away sin, and to slacken wrath: "Come ye to the waters".

      III. Lest any should stand back in the sense of his own sinfulness or
      unworthiness, and inability to do any good, the Lord calls upon such
      persons in special, saying, "He that hath no money, come."

      IV. He craves no more of his merchant, but that he be pleased with the
      wares offered, which are grace, and more grace; and that he heartily
      consent to, and embrace this offer of grace, that so he may close a
      bargain, and a formal covenant with God; "Come, buy without money, come,
      eat:" that is, consent to have, and take to you all saving graces; make
      the wares your own, possess them, and make use of all blessings in Christ;
      whatever makes for your spiritual life and comfort, use and enjoy it
      freely, without paying anything for it: "Come, buy wine and milk without
      money, and without price".

      V. Because the Lord knows how much we are inclined to seek righteousness
      and life by our own performances and satisfaction, to have righteousness
      and life as it were by the way of works, and how loath we are to embrace
      Christ Jesus, and to take life by way of free grace through Jesus Christ,
      upon the terms whereupon it is offered to us; therefore the Lord lovingly
      calls us off this our crooked and unhappy way with a gentle and timeous
      admonition, giving us to understand, that we shall but lose our labour in
      this our way: "Wherefore do ye spend your money for that which is not
      bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not?"

      VI. The Lord promises to us solid satisfaction in the way of taking
      ourselves to the grace of Christ, even true contentment, and fulness of
      spiritual pleasure saying, "Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that
      which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness."

      VII. Because faith comes by hearing, he calls for listening to the
      explanation of the offer, and calls for believing of, and listening to the
      truth, which is able to beget the application of saving faith, and to draw
      the soul to trust in God: "Incline your ear, and come unto me". To which
      end, the Lord promises, that this offer being received, shall quicken the
      dead sinner; and that, upon the welcoming of this offer, he will close the
      covenant of grace with the man that shall consent to it, even an
      everlasting covenant of perpetual reconciliation and peace: "Hearken, and
      your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you."
      Which covenant, he declares, shall be in substance the assigning, and the
      making over, of all the saving graces which David (who is Jesus Christ,
      Acts 13.34) has bought for us in the covenant of redemption: "I will make
      a covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David." By sure mercies, he
      means saving graces, such as are righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
      Spirit, adoption, sanctification, and glorification, and whatever belongs
      to godliness and life eternal.

      VIII. To confirm and assure us of the real grant of these saving mercies,
      and to persuade us of the reality of the covenant between God and the
      believer of this word, the Father has made a fourfold gift of his eternal
      and only begotten Son:

      i. To be incarnate and born for our sake, of the seed of David his type;
      for which cause he is called here, and Acts 13.34, David, the true and
      everlasting King of Israel. This is the great gift of God to man John
      4.10. And here "I have given him to be David," or born of David, "to the
      people."

      ii. He has made a gift of Christ to be a witness to the people, both of
      the sure and saving mercies granted to the redeemed in the covenant of
      redemption; and also of the Father's willingness and purpose to apply
      them, and to make them fast in the covenant of reconciliation made with
      such as embrace the offer: "I have given him to be a witness to the
      people." And truly he is a sufficient witness in this matter in many
      respects:

      a. Because he is one of the blessed Trinity, and party-contractor for us,
      in the covenant of redemption, before the world was. b. He is by office,
      as Mediator, the Messenger of the covenant, and has received a commission
      to reveal it. c. He began actually to reveal in paradise, where he
      promised, that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the
      serpent. d. He set forth his own death and sufferings, and the great
      benefits that should come thereby to us, in the type and figures of
      sacrifices and ceremonies before his coming. e. He gave more and more
      light about this covenant, speaking by his Spirit, from age to age, in the
      holy prophets. f. He came himself, in the fulness of time, and did bear
      witness of all things belonging to this covenant, and of God's willing
      mind to take believers into it; partly, by uniting our nature in one
      person with the divine nature; partly, by preaching the good tidings of
      the covenant with his own mouth; partly, by paying the price of redemption
      on the cross; and partly by dealing still with the people, from the
      beginning to this day, to draw in, and to hold in the redeemed in this
      covenant.

      iii. God has made a gift of Christ, as a leader to the people, to bring us
      through all difficulties, all afflictions and temptations, to life, by
      this covenant: and he it is, and no other, who does indeed lead his own to
      the covenant; and, in the covenant, all the way on to salvation:

      a. By the direction of his word and Spirit. b. By the example of this own
      life, in faith and obedience, even to the death of the cross. c. By his
      powerful working, bearing his redeemed ones in his arms, and causing them
      to lean on him, while they go up through the wilderness.

      iv. God has made a gift of Christ to his people, as a commander: which
      office he faithfully exercises, by giving to his church and people laws
      and ordinances, pastors and elders, and all necessary officers; by keeping
      courts and assemblies among them, to see that his laws are obeyed;
      subduing, by his word, Spirit, and discipline, his people's corruptions;
      and, by his wisdom and power, guarding them against all their enemies
      whatever.

      Hence he who has closed bargain with God may strengthen his faith, by
      reasoning after this manner:

      "Whoever heartily receives the offer of free grace, made here to sinners,
      thirsting for righteousness and salvation: to him, by an everlasting
      covenant, belongs Christ, the true David, with all his sure and saving
      mercies:" "But I (may the weak believer say) do heartily receive the offer
      of free grace made here to sinners, thirsting for righteousness and
      salvation:" "Therefore to me, by an everlasting covenant, belongs Christ
      Jesus, with all his sure and saving mercies."

      ### Section 2

      The second Warrant and special Motive to embrace Christ, and believe in
      him, is the "earnest request" that God makes to us to be reconciled to him
      in Christ; held forth, 2 Cor. 5.19-21

      "To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not
      imputing their trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the word of
      reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
      beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
      God. For he has made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
      might be made the righteousness of God in him."

      Wherein the apostle teaches us these nine doctrines.

      I. That the elect world, or world of redeemed souls, are by nature in the
      estate of enmity against God: this is presupposed in the word
      reconciliation; for reconciliation, or renewing of friendship, cannot be,
      except between those that have been at enmity.

      II. That in all the time past, since the fall of Adam, Christ Jesus, the
      eternal Son of God, as Mediator, and the Father in him, has been about the
      making friendship (by his work and Spirit) between himself and the elect
      world: "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself."

      III. That the way of reconciliation was in all ages one and the same in
      substance, that is, by forgiving the sons of them who do acknowledge their
      sins and their enmity against God, and do seek reconciliation and
      remission of sins in Christ: "For God was in Christ reconciling the world
      unto himself," by way of, "not imputing their trespasses unto them."

      IV. That the end and scope of the gospel, and whole word of God, is
      threefold:

      i. It serves to make people sensitive to their sins, and of their enmity
      against God, and of their danger, if they should stand out, and not fear
      God's displeasure.

      ii. The word of God serves to make men acquainted with the course which
      God has prepared for making friendship with them through Christ, That is,
      that if men shall acknowledge the enmity, and shall be content to enter
      into a covenant of friendship with God through Christ, then God will be
      content to be reconciled with them freely.

      iii. The word of God serves to teach men how to carry themselves toward
      God, as friends, after they are reconciled to him, that is, to be loath to
      sin against him, and to strive heartily to obey his commandments: and
      therefore the word of God here is called "the word of reconciliation",
      because it teaches us what need we have of reconciliation, and how to make
      it, and how to keep the reconciliation of friendship, being made with God
      through Christ.

      V. That albeit the hearing, believing, and obeying of this word, does
      belong to all those to whom this gospel comes; yet the office of preaching
      of it with authority belongs to none, but to such only as God calls to his
      ministry, and sends out with commission for this work. This the apostle
      holds forth, Verse 19. in these words, "He hath committed to us the word
      of reconciliation."

      VI. That the ministers of the gospel should behave themselves as Christ's
      messengers, and should closely follow their commission set down in the
      word, Matt 28.19,20; and when they do so, they should be received by the
      people as ambassadors from God; for here the apostle, in all their names
      say, "We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us."

      VII. That ministers, in all earnestness of affections, should deal with
      people to acknowledge their sins, and their natural enmity against God,
      more and more seriously; and to consent to the covenant of grace and
      ambassador of Christ more and more heartily; and to evidence more and more
      clearly their reconciliation, by a holy carriage before God. This he holds
      forth, when he says, "We pray you, be ye reconciled to God."

      VIII. That in the ministers' affectionate dealing with the people, the
      people should consider what they have to do with God and Christ,
      requesting them, by the ministers, to be reconciled. Now, there cannot be
      a greater inducement to break a sinner's hard heart, than God's making a
      request to him for friendship; for when it became us, who have done so
      many wrongs to God, to seek friendship of God, he comes before us: and (O
      wonder of wonders!) he requests us to be content to be reconciled to him;
      and therefore most fearful wrath must abide on them who make light of this
      request, and do not yield when they hear ministers with commission,
      saying, " We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by
      us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."

      IX. To make it appear how it comes to pass that the covenant of
      reconciliation should be so easily made up between God and a humble sinner
      fleeing to Christ, the apostle leads us to the cause of it, held forth in
      the covenant of redemption, the sum whereof is this:

      "It is agreed between God and the Mediator Jesus Christ the Son of God,
      surety for the redeemed, as the parties of the contract, that the sins of
      the redeemed should be imputed to the innocent Christ, and he both
      condemned and put to death for them, upon this very condition, that
      whoever heartily consents to the covenant of reconciliation offered
      through Christ, shall, by the imputation of his obedience to them, be
      justified and held righteous before God; for God has made Christ, `who
      knew no sin, to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of
      God in him.'"

      Hence may a weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning from this
      ground after this manner:

      "He that, upon the loving request of God and Christ, made to him by the
      mouth of ministers, (having commission to that effect,) has embraced the
      offer of perpetual reconciliation through Christ, and does purpose, by
      God's grace, as a reconciled person, to strive against sin, and to serve
      God to his power constantly, may be as sure to have righteousness and
      eternal life given to him, for the obedience of Christ imputed to him, as
      it is sure that Christ was condemned and put to death for the sins of the
      redeemed imputed to him:" "But I (may the weak believer say) upon the
      loving request of God and Christ, made to me by the mouth of his
      ministers, have embraced the offer or perpetual reconciliation through
      Christ, and do purpose, by God's grace, as a reconciled person, to strive
      against sin, and to serve God to my power constantly:" "Therefore I may be
      as sure to have righteousness and eternal life given to me, for the
      obedience of Christ imputed to me, as it is sure that Christ was condemned
      and put to death for the sins of the redeemed imputed to him."

      ### Section 3

      The third warrant and special Motive to believe in Christ, is the straight
      and "awful command of God", charging all the hearers of the gospel to
      approach to Christ in the order set down by him, and to believe in him; as
      held forth,

      "And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his
      Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment." 1 John
      3.23

      Wherein the apostle gives us to understand these five doctrines:

      I. That if any man shall not accept the sweet invitation of God, or the
      humble and loving request of God, made to him to be reconciled, he shall
      find he has to deal with the sovereign authority of the highest Majesty;
      for "this is his commandment, that we believe in him".

      II. That if any man look upon this commandment as he has looked hereto
      upon the neglected commandments of the law, he must consider that this is
      a command of the gospel, after the law, given for making use of the remedy
      of sins; which, if it be disobeyed, there is no other command to follow
      but this, "Go, ye cursed, into the everlasting fire of hell;" for "this is
      his commandment;" the obedience of which is most pleasant in his sight,
      Verse 22 and without which it is impossible to please him, Heb 11.6.

      III. That every one who hears the gospel, must make conscience of the duty
      of lively faith in Christ; the weak believer must not think it presumption
      to do what is commanded; the person inclined to desperation must take up
      himself, and think upon obedience to sweet and saving command; the strong
      believer must dip yet more in the sense of his need he has of Jesus
      Christ, and more and more grow in the obedience of this command, yes, the
      most impenitent, profane, and wicked person must not thrust out himself,
      or be thrust out by others, from orderly aiming at this duty, how
      desperate ever his condition seems to be; for he that commands all men to
      believe in Christ, does thereby command all men to believe that they are
      damned and lost without Christ: he thereby commands all men to acknowledge
      their sins, and their need of Christ, and in effect commands all men to
      repent, that they may believe in him. And whoever does refuse to repent of
      their past sins, are guilty of disobedience to this command given to all
      hearers, but especially to those that are within the visible church: for
      "this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son
      Jesus Christ".

      IV. That he who obeys this commandment has built his salvation on a solid
      ground: for,

      i. He has found the promised Messiah, completely furnished with all
      perfections to the perfect execution of the offices of Prophet, Priest,
      and King; for he is that Christ in whom the man does believe.

      ii. He has embraced a Saviour, who is able to save to the uttermost, yes,
      who does effectually save every one that comes to God through him; for he
      is Jesus, the true Saviour of his people from their sins.

      iii. He that obeys this command has built his salvation on the Rock, that
      is, on the Son of God, to whom it is no robbery to be called equal to the
      Father, and who is worthy to be the object of saving faith, and of
      spiritual worship: for this is his command, that "we believe in the name
      of his Son Jesus Christ."

      V. That he who has believed on Jesus Christ, though he is freed from the
      curse of the law, is not freed from the command and obedience of the law,
      but tied to it by a new obligation, and a new command from Christ; which
      new command from Christ gives help to obey the command: to which command
      from Christ, the Father adds his authority and command also; for "this is
      his commandment that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and
      love one another, as he has commanded us." The first part of which
      command, enjoining belief in him, necessarily implies love to God, and so
      obedience to the first table; for believing in God, and loving God, are
      inseparable; and the second part of the command enjoins love to our
      neighbour, (especially to the household of faith,) and so obedience to the
      second table of the law.

      Hence may a weak believer strengthen himself, by reasoning from this
      ground after this manner:

      "Whoever, in the sense of his own sinfulness, and fear of God's wrath, at
      the command of God, is fled to Jesus Christ, the only remedy of sin and
      misery, and has engaged his heart to the obedience of the law of love, his
      faith is not presumptuous or dead, but true and saving faith:" "But I,
      (may the weak believer say,) in the sense of my own sinfulness, and fear
      of God's wrath, am fled to Jesus Christ, the only remedy of sin and
      misery, and have engaged my heart to the obedience of the law of love:"
      "Therefore my faith is not a presumptuous and dead faith, but true and
      saving faith."

      ### Section 4

      The fourth Warrant and special Motive to believe in Christ, is "much
      assurance of life" given, in case men shall obey the command of believing;
      and a "fearful certification" of destruction, in case they obey not; as
      held forth,

      "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He
      that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not
      the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." John
      3.35,36

      Wherein are held forth to us these five following doctrines:

      I. That the Father is well satisfied with the undertakings of the Son,
      entered Redeemer and Surety, to pay the ransom of believers and to perfect
      them in holiness and salvation: "the Father loveth the Son,"; that is, as
      he stands as Mediator in our name, undertaking to perfect our redemption
      in all points: The Father loves him, that is, does heartily accept his
      offer to do the work, and is well pleased with him: his soul delights in
      him, and rests upon him, and makes him, in this his office, the
      "receptacle of love, and grace, and good will," to be conveyed by him to
      believers in him.

      II. That, for fulfilling of the covenant of redemption, the Father has
      given to the Son (as he stands in the capacity of the Mediator, or as he
      is God incarnate, the Word made flesh) all authority in heaven and earth,
      all supply of the riches of grace, and of spirit and life, with all power
      and ability, which the union of the divine nature with the human, or which
      the fulness of the Godhead dwelling substantially in his human nature, or
      which the indivisible all-sufficiency and omnipotency of the inseparable,
      every where present Trinity does import, or the work of redemption can
      require: "the Father has given all things into the Son's hand," that is,
      for accomplishing his work.

      III. Great assurance of life is held forth to all who shall heartily
      receive Christ, and the offer of the covenant of grace and reconciliation
      through him: "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life;" for it
      is made certain to him,

      i. In God's purpose and irrevocable decree, as the believer is a man
      elected to life.

      ii. By effectual calling of him to life by God, who, as he is faithful, so
      ill do it.

      iii. By promise and everlasting covenant, sworn by God, to give the
      believer strong consolation in life and death, upon immutable grounds.

      iv. By the pledge and security under the great seal of the ordinance of
      the Lord's supper, so oft as the believer shall come to receive the
      symbols and pledges of life.

      v. In Christ the fountain and head of life, who is entered in possession,
      as attorney for believers; in whom our life is so laid up, that it cannot
      be taken away.

      vi. By being in possession of spiritual life and regeneration, and a
      kingdom consisting in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit,
      erected within the believer, as the earnest of the full possession of
      everlasting life.

      IV. A fearful warning is given, if a man receive not the doctrine
      concerning righteousness and eternal life to be had by Jesus Christ: "He
      that believeth not the Son shall not see life," that is, not so much as
      understand what it means.

      V. He further warns, that if a man receive not the doctrine of the Son of
      God, he shall be burdened twice with the wrath of God; once as a born
      rebel by nature, he shall bear the curse of the law, or the covenant of
      works; and next, he shall endure a greater condemnation, in respect that
      light being come into the world, and offered to him, he has rejected it,
      and loves darkness rather than light: and this double wrath shall be
      fastened and fixed immovably upon him, so long as he remains in the
      condition of unbelief: "The wrath of God abideth on him".

      Hence may the weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning from this
      ground after this manner:

      "Whosoever believes the doctrine delivered by the Son of God, and finds
      himself partly drawn powerfully to believe in him, by the sight of life in
      him, and partly driven, by the fear of God's wrath, to adhere to him, may
      be sure of right and interest to eternal life through him:" "But sinful
      and unworthy I (may the weak believer say) do believe the doctrine
      delivered by the Son of God, and do feel myself partly drawn powerfully to
      believe in him, by the sight of life in him, and partly driven, by the
      fear of God's wrath, to adhere to him:" "Therefore, I may be sure of my
      right and interest to eternal life through him."


  - name: The Evidences of True Faith
    text: |

      ### Section 1

      So much for the laying of the grounds of faith, and warrants to
      believe. Now, for evidencing of true faith by fruits, these four things
      are requisite:

      I. That the believer be soundly convinced, in his judgment, of his
      obligation to keep the whole moral law, all the days of his life; and that
      not the less, but so much the more, as he is delivered by Christ from the
      covenant of works, and curse of the law.

      II. That he endeavour to grow in the exercise and daily practice of
      godliness and righteousness.

      III. That the course of his new obedience run in the right channel, that
      is through faith in Christ, and through a good conscience, to all the
      duties of love towards God and man.

      IV. That he keep strait communion with the fountain Christ Jesus, from
      whom grace must run along, for furnishing of good fruits.

      For the first, that is, to convince the believer, in his judgment, of his
      obligation to keep the moral law, among many passages:

      "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
      and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to
      destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
      fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
      one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
      fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
      commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the
      kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach [them], the same shall
      be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, That except
      your righteousness shall exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and
      Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."
      Mat. 5.16-20

      Wherein our Lord,

      i. Gives commandment to believers, justified by faith, to give evidence of
      the grace of God in them before men, by doing good works: "Let your light
      so shine before men that they may see your good works."

      ii. He induces them so to do, by showing, that albeit they be not
      justified by works, yet spectators of their good works may be converted or
      edified; and so glory may redound to God by their good works, when its
      witnesses "shall glorify your Father which is in heaven."

      iii. He gives them no other rule for their new obedience than the moral
      law, set down and explicated by Moses and the prophets: "Think not that I
      am come to destroy the law or the prophets."

      iv. He gives them to understand, that the doctrine of grace, and freedom
      from the curse of the law by faith in him, is readily mistaken by men's
      corrupt judgments, as if it did loose or slacken the obligation of
      believers to obey the commands, and to be subject to the authority of the
      law; and that this error is indeed a destroying of the law and of the
      prophets, which he will in no case ever endure in any of his disciples, it
      is so contrary to the end of his coming, which is first to sanctify, and
      then to save believers: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law or
      the prophets."

      v. He teaches, that the end of the gospel and covenant of grace is to
      procure men's obedience to the moral law: "I am come to fulfil the law and
      the prophets."

      vi. That the obligation of the moral law, in all points, to all holy
      duties, is perpetual, and shall stand to the world's end, that is, "till
      heaven and earth pass away."

      vii. That as God has had a care of the Scripture from the beginning, so
      shall he have a care of them still to the world's end, that there shall
      not one jot or one tittle of its substance be taken away; so says the
      text, Verse 18.

      viii. That as the breaking of the moral law, and defending its
      transgressions to be no sin, does exclude men both from heaven, and justly
      also from the fellowship of the true church; so the obedience of the law,
      and teaching others to do the same, by example, counsel, and doctrine,
      according to every man's calling, proves a man to be a true believer, and
      in great estimation with God, and worthy to be much esteemed of by the
      true church, Verse 19.

      ix. That the righteousness of every true Christian must be more than the
      righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees; for the scribes and Pharisees,
      albeit they took great pains to discharge various duties of the law, yet
      they cut short its exposition, that it might the less condemn their
      practice; they studied the outward part of the duty, but neglected the
      inward and spiritual part; they discharged some lesser duties carefully,
      but neglected judgment, mercy, and the love of God: in a word, they went
      about to establish their own righteousness, and rejected the righteousness
      of God by faith in Jesus. But a true Christian must have more than all
      this; he must acknowledge the full extent of the spiritual meaning of the
      law, and have a respect to all the commandments, and labour to cleanse
      himself from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and "not lay weight upon
      what service he has done, or shall do," but clothe himself with the
      imputed righteousness of Christ, which only can hide his nakedness, or
      else he cannot be saved; so says the text, "Except your righteousness, ..."

      ### Section 2

      The second thing requisite to evidence of true faith is, that the believer
      endeavour to put the rules of godliness and righteousness in practice, and
      to grow in its daily exercise; as held forth:

      "And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to
      virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience;
      and to patience godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to
      brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound,
      they make [you that ye shall] neither [be] barren nor unfruitful in the
      knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." 2 Pe. 1:5-8 Wherein,

      I. The apostle teaches believers, for evidencing of precious faith in
      themselves, to endeavour to add to their faith seven other sister graces.

      i. The first is Virtue, or the active exercise and practice of all moral
      duties, that so faith is not idle, but puts forth itself in work.

      ii. The second is Knowledge, which serves to furnish faith with
      information of the truth to be believed, and to furnish virtue with
      direction what duties are to be done, and how to go about them prudently.

      iii. The third is Temperance, which serves to moderate the use of all
      pleasant things, that a man be not clogged therewith, nor made unfit for
      any duty to which he is called.

      iv. The fourth is Patience, which serves to moderate a man's affections,
      when he meets with any difficulty or unpleasant thing; that he neither
      weary for pains required in well-doing, nor faint when the Lord chastises
      him, nor murmur when he crosses him.

      v. The fifth is Godliness, which may keep him up in all the exercises of
      religion, inward and outward; whereby he may be furnished from God for all
      other duties which he has to do.

      vi. The sixth is Brotherly-kindness, which keeps estimation of, and
      affection to, all the household of faith, and to the image of God in every
      one where ever it is seen.

      vii. The seventh is Love, which keeps the heart in readiness to do good to
      all men, whatever they be, upon all occasions which God shall offer.

      II. Albeit it be true, that this is much corruption and infirmity in the
      godly; yet the apostle will have men mightily endeavouring, and doing
      their best, as they are able, to join all these graces one to another, and
      to grow in the measure of exercising them: "Giving all diligence, add to
      your faith, ..."

      III. He assures all professed believers, that as they shall profit in the
      obedience of this direction, so they shall profitably prove the soundness
      of their own faith; and if they not have these graces, that they shall be
      found blind deceivers of themselves, Verse 9. T5852 The Evidences of True
      Faith

      ### Section 3

      The third thing requisite to evidence true faith is, that obedience to the
      law run in the right channel, that is, through faith in Christ, etc. as
      held forth:

      "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a
      good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:" 1 Ti. 1:5 Wherein the apostle
      teaches these seven doctrines:

      I. That the obedience of the law must flow from love, and love from a pure
      heart, and a pure heart from a good conscience, and a good conscience from
      faith unfeigned: this he makes the only right channel of good works: "The
      end of the law is love, ..."

      II. That the end of law is not, that men may be justified by their
      obedience of it, as the Jewish doctors did falsely teach; for it is
      impossible that sinners can be justified by the law, who, for every
      transgression, are condemned by the law: "For the end of the law is (not
      such as the Jewish doctors taught, but) love, out of a pure heart, ..."

      III. That the true end of the law, preached to the people, is, that they,
      by the law, being made to see their deserved condemnation, should flee to
      Christ unfeignedly, to be justified by faith in him; so says the text,
      while it makes love to flow through faith in Christ.

      IV. That no man can set himself in love to obey the law, excepting as far
      as his conscience is quieted by faith, or is seeking to be quieted in
      Christ; for "the end of the law is love, out of good conscience, and faith
      unfeigned."

      V. That feigned faith goes to Christ without reckoning with the law, and
      so wants an errand; but unfeigned faith reckons with the law, and is
      forced to flee for refuge to Christ, as the end of the law for
      righteousness, so often as it finds itself guilty for breaking of the law:
      "For the end of the law is faith unfeigned."

      VI. That the fruits of love may come forth in act particularly, it is
      necessary that the heart be brought to the hatred of all sin and
      uncleanness, and to a steadfast purpose to follow all holiness
      universally: "For the end of the law is love, out of a pure heart."

      VII. That unfeigned faith is able to make the conscience good, and the
      heart pure, and the man lovingly obedient to the law; for when Christ's
      blood is seen by faith to quiet justice, then the conscience becomes quiet
      also, and will not suffer the heart to entertain the love of sin, but set
      the man on work to fear God for his mercy, and to obey all his
      commandments, out of love to God, for his free gift of justification, by
      grace bestowed on him: "For this is the end of the law indeed," whereby it
      obtains of a man more obedience than any other way.

      ### Section 4

      The fourth thing requisite to evidence true faith is, the "keeping strait
      communion with Christ," the fountain of all graces, and of all good works;
      as held forth:

      "I am the vine, ye [are] the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in
      him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
      nothing." John 15:5

      Wherein Christ, in a similitude from a vine-tree, teaches us,

      I. That by nature we are wild barren briers, till we be changed by coming
      to Christ; and that Christ is that noble vine-tree, having all life and
      sap of grace in himself, and able to change the nature of every one that
      comes to him, and to communicate spirit and life to as many as shall
      believe in him: "I am the vine, and ye are the branches."

      II. That Christ loves to have believers so united to him, as that they be
      not separated at any time by unbelief: and that there may be a mutual
      inhabitation of them in him, by faith and love; and of him in them, by his
      word and Spirit; for he joins these together, "If ye abide in me, and I in
      you," as things inseparable.

      III. That except a man be ingrafted into Christ, and united to him by
      faith, he cannot do any the least good works of his own strength; yes,
      except in as far as a man does draw spirit and life from Christ by faith,
      the work which he does is naughty and null in point of goodness in God's
      estimation: "For without me ye can do nothing."

      IV. That this mutual inhabitation is the fountain and infallible cause of
      constant continuing and abounding in well-doing: For "he that abideth in
      me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit." Now, as our abiding in
      Christ presupposes three things;

      i. That we have heard the joyful sound of the gospel, making offer of
      Christ to us, who are lost sinners by the law;

      ii. That we have heartily embraced the gracious offer of Christ;

      iii. That by receiving of him we are become the sons of God, John 1:12,
      and are incorporated into his mystical body, that he may dwell in us, as
      his temple, and we dwell in him, as in the residence of righteousness and
      life:

      So our abiding in Christ imports other three things,

      iv. An employing of Christ in all our addresses to God, and in all our
      undertakings of whatever piece of service to him.

      v. A contentedness with this sufficiency, without going out from him to
      seek righteousness, or life, or help in any case, in our own or any of the
      creature's worthiness.

      vi. A fixedness in our believing in him, a fixedness in our employing and
      making use of him, and a fixedness in our contentment in him, and adhering
      to him, so that no allurement, not temptation of Satan or the world, no
      terror nor trouble, may be able to drive our spirits from firm adherence
      to him, or from the constant avowing of his truth, and obeying his
      commands, who has loved us, and given himself for us; and in whom not only
      our life is laid up, but also the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, by
      reason of the substantial and personal union of the divine and human
      nature in him. Hence let every watchful believer, for strengthening
      himself in faith and obedience, reason after this manner:

      "Whoever does daily employ Christ Jesus for cleansing his conscience and
      affections from the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the law, and
      for enabling him to give obedience to the law in love, he has the evidence
      of true faith in himself:" "But I (may every watchful believer say) do
      daily employ Jesus Christ for cleansing my conscience and affections from
      the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the law, and for enabling of
      me to give obedience to the law in love:" "Therefore I have the evidence
      of true faith in myself."

      And hence also let the sleepy and sluggish believer reason, for his own
      upstirring, thus:

      "Whatever is necessary for giving evidence of true faith, I study to do
      it, except I would deceive myself and perish:" "But to employ Christ Jesus
      daily for cleansing of my conscience and affections from the guiltiness
      and filthiness of sins against the law, and for enabling me to give
      obedience to the law in love, is necessary for evidencing of true faith in
      me:" "Therefore this I must study to do, except I would deceive myself and
      perish."

      And, lastly, Seeing Christ himself has pointed this forth, as an undoubted
      evidence of a man elected of God to life, and given to Jesus Christ to be
      redeemed, "if he come unto him," that is, close covenant, and keep
      communion with him, as he teaches in John 6.37, saying:

      "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me
      I will in no wise cast out;" let every person, who does not in earnest
      make use of Christ for remission of sin, and amendment of life, reason
      hence, and from the whole premises, after this manner, that his conscience
      may be awakened:

      "Whoever is neither by the law, nor by the gospel, so convinced of sin,
      righteousness, and judgment, as to make him come to Christ, and employ him
      daily for remission of sin, and amendment of life; he wants not only all
      evidence of saving faith, but also all appearance of his election, so long
      as he remains in this condition:"

      "But I (may every impenitent person say) am neither by the law nor gospel
      so convinced of sin, righteousness, and judgment, as to make me come to
      Christ, and employ him daily for remission of sin, and amendment of life:"

      "Therefore I lack not only all evidence of saving faith, but also all
      appearance of my election, so long as I remain in this condition."
