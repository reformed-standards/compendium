          Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence,
          do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men
          inexcusable;[a] yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God,
          and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation;[b] therefore it pleased
          the Lord, at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and
          to declare that his will unto his Church;[c] and afterwards, for the better
          preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment
          and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice
          of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing;[d] which
          maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary;[e] those former ways of
          God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.[f]

          The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are
          no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are of no authority
          in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of,

          The authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and
          obeyed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly
          upon God (who is truth itself), the Author thereof; and therefore it is
          to be received, because it is the Word of God.[a]

          We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church to an high and
          reverent esteem of the holy Scripture;[a] and the heavenliness of the matter,
          the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all
          the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the
          full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, the many other
          incomparable excellencies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments
          whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet, notwithstanding,
          our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority
          thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by
          and with the Word in our hearts.[b]

          The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for his own glory,
          man's salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture,
          or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto
          which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of
          the Spirit, or traditions of men.[a] Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward
          illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding
          of such things as are revealed in the Word;[b] and that there are some circumstances
          concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church, common to human
          actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and
          Christian prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are
          always to be observed.[c]

          All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear
          unto all;[a] yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed,
          and observed, for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some
          place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned,
          in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding
          of them.[b]

          The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people
          of God of old), and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the
          writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being immediately
          inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all
          ages, are therefore authentical;[a] so as in all controversies of religion
          the Church is finally to appeal unto them.[b] But because these original
          tongues are not known to all the people of God who have right unto, and
          interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded, in the fear of God, to read
          and search them,[c] therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar
          language of every nation unto which they come,[d] that the Word of God dwelling
          plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner,[e] and,
          through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, may have hope.[f]

          The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself;
          and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of
          any scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and
          known by other places that speak more clearly.[a]

          be things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves and others;[a]

          Although true believers be not under the law as a covenant of works, to
          be thereby justified or condemned;[a] yet is it of great use to them, as
          well as to others; in that, as a rule of life, informing them of the will
          of God and their duty, it directs and binds them to walk accordingly;[b]
          discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts, and lives;[c]
          so as, examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction
          of, humiliation for, and hatred against sin;[d] together with a clearer
          sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his obedience.[e]
          It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to restrain their corruptions,
          in that it forbids sin;[f] and the threatenings of it serve to show what
          even their sins deserve, and what afflictions in this life they may expect
          for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law.[g]
          The promises of it, in like manner, show them God's approbation of obedience,
          and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof;[h] although
          not as due to them by the law as a covenant of works:[i] so as a man's doing
          good, and refraining from evil, because the law encourageth to the one,
          and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law,
          and not under grace.[k]

          The liberty which Christ hath purchased for believers under the gospel consists
          in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the
          curse of the moral law;[a] and in their being delivered from this present
          evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin,[b] from the evil of afflictions,
          the sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation;[c]
          as also in their free access to God,[d] and their yielding obedience unto
          him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind.[e]
          All which were common also to believers under the law;[f] but under the
          New Testament the liberty of Christians is further enlarged in their freedom
          from the yoke of the ceremonial law, to which the Jewish Church was subjected;[g]
          and in greater boldness of access to the throne of grace,[h] and in fuller
          communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did
          ordinarily partake of.[i]

          God alone is Lord of the conscience,[a] and hath left it free from the doctrines
          and commandments of men which are in anything contrary to his Word, or beside
          it, in matters of faith or worship.[b] So that to believe such doctrines,
          or to obey such commands out of conscience, is to betray true liberty of
          conscience;[c] and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and

          obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal
          torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the
          presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.[d]

          As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be
          a day of judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater
          consolation of the godly in their adversity:[a] so will he have that day
          unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be
          always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will
          come; and may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord Jesus, come
          quickly. Amen.[b]
