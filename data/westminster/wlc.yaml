      soul,[3] he rose again from the dead the third day by his own
      power;[4] whereby he declared himself to be the Son of God,[5] to have
      satisfied divine justice,[6] to have vanquished death, and him that
      had the power of it,[7] and to be Lord of quick and dead:[8] all which
      he did as a public person,[9] the head of his church,[10] for their
      justification,[11] quickening in grace,[12] support against

      Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real,
      and full satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are

      surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this
      surety, his own only Son,[2] imputing his righteousness to them,[3]
      and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,[4]
      which also is his gift,[5] their justification is to them of free
      grace.[6]

    answer: >-
      Justifying faith is a saving grace,[1] wrought in the heart of a
      sinner by the Spirit [2] and word of God,[3] whereby he, being
      convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and
      all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,[4] not
      only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,[5] but
      receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held
      forth, for pardon of sin,[6] and for the accepting and accounting of
      his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.[7]

      How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?
    number: 73
    answer: >-
      Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those
      other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are
      the fruits of it,[3] nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof,
      were imputed to him for his justification;[2] but only as it is an
      instrument by which he receiveth and applies Christ and his
      righteousness.[3]

      the Spirit of his Son given to them,[5] are under his fatherly care
      and dispensations,[6] admitted to all the liberties and privileges of
      the sons of God, made heirs of all the promises, and fellow heirs with

      through the powerful operation of his Spirit [1] applying the death
      and resurrection of Christ unto them,[2] renewed in their whole man
      after the image of God;[3] having the seeds of repentance unto life,
      and all other saving graces, put into their hearts,[4] and those
      graces so stirred up, increased, and strengthened,[5] as that they
      more and more die unto sin, and rise unto newness of life.[6]

      and sense, not only of the danger,[4] but also of the filthiness and
      odiousness of his sins,[5] and upon the apprehension of God's mercy in
      Christ to such as are penitent,[6] he so grieves for [7] and hates his
      sins,[8] as that he turns from them all to God,[9] purposing and

      Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?
    number: 77
    answer: >-
      Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification,[1]
      yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the
      righteousness of Christ;[2] in sanctification his Spirit infuseth
      grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof;[3] in the former, sin is
      pardoned;[4] in the other, it is subdued:[5] the one doth equally free
      all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in
      this life, that they never fall into condemnation;[6] the other is
      neither equal in all,[7] nor in this life perfect in any,[8] but
      growing up to perfection.[9]

    number: 78
    answer: >-
      The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the
      remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual
      lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often
      foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins,[1] are hindered in
      all their spiritual services,[2] and their best works are imperfect
      and defiled in the sight of God.[3]

    answer: >-
      True believers, by reason of the unchangeable love of God,[1] and his
      decree and covenant to give them perseverance,[2] their inseparable
      union with Christ,[3] his continual intercession for them,[4] and the
      Spirit and seed of God abiding in them,[5] can neither totally nor

      they never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of
      God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.[4]

      The members of the invisible church have communicated to them in this

      God's love,[2] peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and hope of
      glory;[3] as, on the contrary, sense of God's revenging wrath, horror
      of conscience, and a fearful expectation of judgment, are to the
      wicked the beginning of their torments which they shall endure after

      The communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible

      the full redemption of their bodies,[4] which even in death continue
      united to Christ,[5] and rest in their graves as in their beds,[6]

      the souls of the wicked are at their death cast into hell, where they
      remain in torments and utter darkness, and their bodies kept in their

    answer: >-
      At the day of judgment, the righteous, being caught up to Christ in
      the clouds,[1] shall be set on his right hand, and there openly
      acknowledged and acquitted,[2] shall join with him in the judging of
      reprobate angels and men,[3] and shall be received into heaven,[4]
      where they shall be fully and forever freed from all sin and
      misery;[5] filled with inconceivable joys,[6] made perfectly holy and
      happy both in body and soul, in the company of innumerable saints and
      holy angels,[7] but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of
      God the Father, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, to
      all eternity.[8] And this is the perfect and full communion, which the
      members of the invisible church shall enjoy with Christ in glory, at
      the resurrection and day of judgment.

      Although no man, since the fall, can attain to righteousness and life

      The moral law is of use to all men, to inform them of the holy nature
      and will of God,[1] and of their duty, binding them to walk
      accordingly;[2] to convince them of their disability to keep it, and
      of the sinful pollution of their nature, hearts, and lives;[3] to
      humble them in the sense of their sin and misery,[4] and thereby help
      them to a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ,[5] and of the
      perfection of his obedience.[6]

      The moral law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their
      consciences to flee from wrath to come,[1] and to drive them to

      leave them inexcusable,[3] and under the curse thereof.[4]

      Although they that are regenerate, and believe in Christ, be delivered
      from the moral law as a covenant of works,[1] so as thereby they are
      neither justified [2] nor condemned;[3] yet, besides the general uses
      thereof common to them with all men, it is of special use, to show
      them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling it, and
      enduring the curse thereof in their stead, and for their good;[4] and
      thereby to provoke them to more thankfulness,[5] and to express the
      same in their greater care to conform themselves thereunto as the rule
      of their obedience.[6]

      What rules are to be observed for the right understanding of the ten
      commandments?
    number: 99
    answer: >-

      For the right understanding of the ten commandments, these rules are
      to be observed: 1. That the law is perfect, and bindeth everyone to
      full conformity in the whole man unto the righteousness thereof, and
      unto entire obedience forever; so as to require the utmost perfection
      of every duty, and to forbid the least degree of every sin.[1] 2.
      That it is spiritual, and so reaches the understanding, will,
      affections, and all other powers of the soul; as well as words, works,
      and gestures.[2] 3. That one and the same thing, in divers respects, is
      required or forbidden in several commandments.[3] 4. That as, where a
      duty is commanded, the contrary sin is forbidden;[4] and, where a sin
      is forbidden, the contrary duty is commanded:[5] so, where a promise
      is annexed, the contrary threatening is included;[6] and, where a
      threatening is annexed, the contrary promise is included.[7] 5. That
      what God forbids, is at no time to be done;[8] What he commands,
      is always our duty;[9] and yet every particular duty is not to be
      done at all times.[10] 6. That under one sin or duty, all of the
      same kind are forbidden or commanded; together with all the causes,
      means, occasions, and appearances thereof, and provocations thereunto.[11]
      7. That what is forbidden or commanded to ourselves, we are bound,
      according to our places, to endeavor that it may be avoided or
      performed by others, according to the duty of their places.[12]
      8. That in what is commanded to others, we are bound, according to
      our places and callings, to be helpful to them;[13] and to take heed
      of partaking with others in what is forbidden them.[14]

      sovereignty, as being JEHOVAH, the eternal, immutable, and almighty
      God;[2] having his being in and of himself,[3] and giving being to all
      his words [4] and works:[5] and that he is a God in covenant, as with
      Israel of old, so with all his people;[6] who, as he brought them out
      of their bondage in Egypt, so he delivers us from our spiritual
      thraldom;[7] and that therefore we are bound to take him for our God
      alone, and to keep all his commandments.[8]

      The reasons annexed to the third commandment, in these words, The Lord
      thy God, and, For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his
      name in vain,[1] are, because he is the Lord and our God, therefore
      his name is not to be profaned, or any way abused by us;[2] especially
      because he will be so far from acquitting and sparing the
      transgressors of this commandment, as that he will not suffer them to
      escape his righteous judgment,[3] albeit many such escape the censures
      and punishments of men.[4]

      The fourth commandment is, Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
      Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is
      the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
      thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
      maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
      gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and
      all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
      blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.[1]

      The fourth commandment requires of all men the sanctifying or keeping

      ever since, and so to continue to the end of the world; which is the
      Christian sabbath,[1] and in the New Testament called The Lord's
      day.[2]

      The sabbath or Lord's day is to be sanctified by an holy resting all
      the day,[1] not only from such works as are at all times sinful, but
      even from such worldly employments and recreations as are on other
      days lawful;[2] and making it our delight to spend the whole time
      (except so much of it as is to betaken up in works of necessity and
      mercy)[3] in the public and private exercises of God's worship:[4]
      and, to that end, we are to prepare our hearts, and with such
      foresight, diligence, and moderation, to dispose and seasonably
      dispatch our worldly business, that we may be the more free and fit
      for the duties of that day.[5]

    answer: >-
      The charge of keeping the sabbath is more specially directed to
      governors of families, and other superiors, because they are bound not
      only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all
      those that are under their charge; and because they are prone ofttimes
      to hinder them by employments of their own.[1]

    number: 120
    answer: >-
      The reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it,
      are taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for
      our own affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words,
      Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:[1] from God's
      challenging a special propriety in that day, The seventh day is the
      sabbath of the Lord thy God:[2] from the example of God, who in six
      days made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
      rested the seventh day: and from that blessing which God put upon that
      day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service, but in
      ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it;
      Wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.[3]

      Why is the word Remember set in the beginning of the fourth
      commandment?
    number: 121
    answer: >-
      The word Remember is set in the beginning of the fourth
      commandment,[1] partly, because of the great benefit of remembering
      it, we being thereby helped in our preparation to keep it,[2] and, in
      keeping it, better to keep all the rest of the commandments,[3] and to
      continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of creation
      and redemption, which contain a short abridgment of religion;[4] and
      partly, because we are very ready to forget it,[5] for that there is
      less light of nature for it,[6] and yet it restraineth our natural
      liberty in things at other times lawful;[7] that it comesthbut once in
      seven days, and many worldly businesses come between, and too often
      take off our minds from thinking of it, either to prepare for it, or
      to sanctify it;[8] and that Satan with his instruments much labor to
      blot out the glory, and even the memory of it, to bring in all
      irreligion and impiety.[9]

      How do the sacraments become effectual means of salvation?
    number: 161
    answer: >-
      The sacraments become effectual means of salvation, not by any power
      in themselves, or any virtue derived from the piety or intention of
      him by whom they are administered, but only by the working of the Holy
      Ghost, and the blessing of Christ, by whom they are instituted.[1]

      into himself,[2] of remission of sins by his blood,[3] and
      regeneration by his Spirit;[4] of adoption,[5] and resurrection unto

      descending from parents, either both, or but one of them, professing
      faith in Christ, and obedience to him, are in that respect within the
      covenant, and to be baptized.[2]

      The needful but much neglected duty of improving our Baptism, is to be
      performed by us all our life long, especially in the time of
      temptation, and when we are present at the administration of it to
      others;[1] by serious and thankful consideration of the nature of it,
      and of the ends for which Christ instituted it, the privileges and
      benefits conferred and sealed thereby, and our solemn vow made
      therein;[2] by being humbled for our sinful defilement, our falling
      short of, and walking contrary to, the grace of baptism, and our
      engagements;[3] by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin, and of
      all other blessings sealed to us in that sacrament;[4] by drawing
      strength from the death and resurrection of Christ, into whom we are
      baptized, for the mortifying of sin, and quickening of grace;[5] and
      by endeavoring to live by faith,[6] to have our conversation in
      holiness and righteousness,[7] as those that have therein given up
      their names to Christ;[8] and to walk in brotherly love, as being
      baptized by the same Spirit into one body.[9]

      As the body and blood of Christ are not corporally or carnally present
      in, with, or under the bread and wine in the Lord's supper,[1] and yet
      are spiritually present to the faith of the receiver, no less truly
      and really than the elements themselves are to their outward
      senses;[2] so they that worthily communicate in the sacrament of the
      Lord's supper, do therein feed upon the body and blood of Christ, not
      after a corporal and carnal, but in a spiritual manner; yet truly and
      really,[3] while by faith they receive and apply unto themselves
      Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death.[4]

      One who doubteth of his being in Christ, or of his due preparation to

      though he be not yet assured thereof;[1] and in God's account hath it,
      if he be duly affected with the apprehension of the want of it,[2] and
      unfeignedly desires to be found in Christ,[3] and to depart from
      iniquity:[4] in which case (because promises are made, and this
      sacrament is appointed, for the relief even of weak and doubting
      Christians)[5] he is to bewail his unbelief,[6] and labor to have his
      doubts resolved;[7] and, so doing, he may and ought to come to the
      Lord's supper, that he may be further strengthened.[8]

      The duty of Christians, after they have received the sacrament of the
      Lord's supper, is seriously to consider how they have behaved
      themselves therein, and with what success;[1] if they find quickening
      and comfort, to bless God for it,[2] beg the continuance of it,[3]
      watch against relapses,[4] fulfil their vows,[5] and encourage
      themselves to a frequent attendance on that ordinance:[6] but if they
      find no present benefit, more exactly to review their preparation to,
      and carriage at, the sacrament;[7] in both which, if they can approve
      themselves to God and their own consciences, they are to wait for the
      fruit of it in due time:[8] but, if they see they have failed in
      either, they are to be humbled,[9] and to attend upon it afterwards
      with more care and diligence.[10]

      Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper agree?
    number: 176
    answer: >-
      The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper agree, in that the
      author of both is God;[1] the spiritual part of both is Christ and his
      benefits;[2] both are seals of the same covenant,[3] are to be
      dispensed by ministers of the gospel, and by none other;[4] and to be
      continued in the church of Christ until his second coming.[5]

      Wherein do the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper differ?
    number: 177
    answer: >-
      The sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper differ, in that
      baptism is to be administered but once, with water, to be a sign and
      seal of our regeneration and ingrafting into Christ,[1] and that even
      to infants;[2] whereas the Lord's supper is to be administered often,
      in the elements of bread and wine, to represent and exhibit Christ as
      spiritual nourishment to the soul,[3] and to confirm our continuance
      and growth in him,[4] and that only to such as are of years and
      ability to examine themselves.[5]

      What is it to pray in the name of Christ?
    number: 180
    answer: >-
      To pray in the name of Christ is, in obedience to his command, and in
      confidence on his promises, to ask mercy for his sake;[1] not by bare
      mentioning of his name,[2] but by drawing our encouragement to pray,
      and our boldness, strength, and hope of acceptance in prayer, from
      Christ and his mediation.[3]

    number: 181

      The sinfulness of man, and his distance from God by reason thereof,
      being so great, as that we can have no access into his presence
      without a mediator;[1] and there being none in heaven or earth
      appointed to, or fit for, that glorious work but Christ alone,[2] we
      are to pray in no other name but his only.[3]

      We not knowing what to pray for as we ought, the Spirit helps our
      infirmities, by enabling us to understand both for whom, and what,
      and how prayer is to be made; and by working and quickening in our
      hearts (although not in all persons, nor at all times, in the same
      measure) those apprehensions, affections, and graces which are
      requisite for the right performance of that duty.[1]

      The whole word of God is of use to direct us in the duty of prayer;[1]

      Savior Christ taught his disciples, commonly called The Lord's
      prayer.[2]

      The Lord's prayer is not only for direction, as a pattern, according

      furnished with all gospel officers and ordinances,[7] purged from
      corruption,[8] countenanced and maintained by the civil magistrate:[9]
      that the ordinances of Christ may be purely dispensed, and made
      effectual to the converting of those that are yet in their sins, and
      the confirming, comforting, and building up of those that are already
      converted:[10] that Christ would rule in our hearts here,[11] and
      hasten the time of his second coming, and our reigning with him

      able to sustain us,[3] nor we to merit,[4] or by our own industry to
      procure them;[5] but prone to desire,[6] get,[7] and use them
      unlawfully:[8] we pray for ourselves and others, that both they and
      we, waiting upon the providence of God from day to day in the use of
      lawful means, may, of his free gift, and as to his fatherly wisdom
      shall seem best, enjoy a competent portion of them;[9] and have the
      same continued and blessed unto us in our holy and comfortable use of
      them,[10] and contentment in them;[11] and be kept from all things
      that are contrary to our temporal support and comfort.[12]

      What do we pray for in the fifth petition?
    number: 194
    answer: >-
      In the fifth petition (which is, Forgive us our debts, as we forgive
      our debtors,)[1] acknowledging, that we and all others are guilty both
      of original and actual sin, and thereby become debtors to the justice
      of God; and that neither we, nor any other creature, can make the
      least satisfaction for that debt:[2] we pray for ourselves and others,
      that God of his free grace would, through the obedience and
      satisfaction of Christ, apprehended and applied by faith, acquit us
      both from the guilt and punishment of sin,[3] accept us in his
      Beloved;[4] continue his favor and grace to us,[5] pardon our daily
      failings,[6] and fill us with peace and joy, in giving us daily more
      and more assurance of forgiveness;[7] which we are the rather
      emboldened to ask, and encouraged to expect, when we have this
      testimony in ourselves, that we from the heart forgive others their
      offenses.[8]

      What do we pray for in the sixth petition?
    number: 195
    answer: >-
      In the sixth petition (which is, And lead us not into temptation, but
      deliver us from evil,)[1] acknowledging, that the most wise,
      righteous, and gracious God, for divers holy and just ends, may so
      order things, that we may be assaulted, foiled, and for a time led
      captive by temptations;[2] that Satan,[3] the world,[4] and the flesh,
      are ready powerfully to draw us aside, and ensnare us;[5] and that we,
      even after the pardon of our sins, by reason of our corruption,[6]
      weakness, and want of watchfulness,[7] are not only subject to be
      tempted, and forward to expose ourselves unto temptations,[8] but also
      of ourselves unable and unwilling to resist them, to recover out of
      them, and to improve them;[9] and worthy to be left under the power of
      them:[10] we pray, that God would so overrule the world and all in
      it,[11] subdue the flesh,[12] and restrain Satan,[13] order all
      things,[14] bestow and bless all means of grace,[15] and quicken us to
      watchfulness in the use of them, that we and all his people may by his
      providence be kept from being tempted to sin;[16] or, if tempted, that
      by his Spirit we may be powerfully supported and enabled to stand in
      the hour of temptation;[17] or when fallen, raised again and recovered
      out of it,[18] and have a sanctified use and improvement thereof:[19]
      that our sanctification and salvation may be perfected,[20] Satan
      trodden under our feet,[21] and we fully freed from sin, temptation,
      and all evil, forever.[22]

      What doth the conclusion of the Lord's prayer teach us?
    number: 196
    answer: >-
      The conclusion of the Lord's prayer (which is, For thine is the
      kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.),[1] teaches us
      to enforce our petitions with arguments,[2] which are to be taken, not
      from any worthiness in ourselves, or in any other creature, but from
      God;[3] and with our prayers to join praises,[4] ascribing to God
      alone eternal sovereignty, omnipotency, and glorious excellency;[5] in
      regard whereof, as he is able and willing to help us,[6] so we by
      faith are emboldened to plead with him that he would,[7] and quietly
      to rely upon him, that he will fulfil our requests.[8] And, to testify
      this our desire and assurance, we say, Amen.[9]
